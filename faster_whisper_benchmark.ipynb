            "[3201.24s -> 3207.96s]  first came up with the idea of separation. And what type of other choices that we have discussed\n",
            "[3207.96s -> 3216.52s]  other than the separation of the entities? Now, this is Tsunakawa. May I answer to your question?\n",

            "[3226.76s -> 3232.44s]  almost every week for the last five months. There were many strategic options that we discussed\n",
            "[3232.44s -> 3241.48s]  and also that were reviewed of the medium-term plan that we have compiled. And also, we at the\n",

            "[3248.68s -> 3256.52s]  compared many options. Now, in regard to the ideas of tax-free spin-off, while we were discussing\n",
            "[3258.12s -> 3264.12s]  and after the end of the discussion between SRC and the board, we came up with this idea.\n",

            "[3273.08s -> 3278.60s]  pursuing this option of a tax-free spin-off. I believe that this is the best possible\n",

            "[3282.52s -> 3286.92s]  Are there any other options that we have discussed? Could you elaborate on that?\n",
            "[3286.92s -> 3294.12s]  Could you repeat the question? So, when the spin-off idea surfaced and\n",
            "[3295.32s -> 3300.60s]  SRC or the sales management, who was the first one to say? And were there any other options?\n",
            "[3302.44s -> 3315.64s]  Regarding other options, well, SRC will issue a report at a later date about how the discussion\n",
            "[3315.64s -> 3321.96s]  has developed. It was about 10 pages long, a document that we intend to publish in due course,\n",
            "[3321.96s -> 3330.52s]  but it was several months ago that this particular idea surfaced. And SRC, we at the management and\n",
            "[3330.52s -> 3336.92s]  advisors, all parties involved and made a discussion. In the course of the whole discussion,\n",
            "[3337.88s -> 3346.28s]  we came up with the idea of a tax-free spin-off and the feasibility of that idea was recognized\n",
            "[3346.28s -> 3353.88s]  as a viable option. And ultimately, we came up with the idea of a separation into three companies\n",
            "[3353.88s -> 3358.12s]  and the executive side had proposed this idea. May I move on to the second question then?\n",
            "[3358.92s -> 3366.92s]  Second question is, now regarding the future growth. Now, spin-off is just talking about\n",
            "[3366.92s -> 3373.00s]  the institution. It is means, but how are you going to make growth in real-term basis that\n",
            "[3373.00s -> 3379.64s]  I'd like to explore with you. Reason is that in regard to the Toshiba Next Plan,\n",

            "[3387.72s -> 3393.32s]  of operating income margin, that was the target. And a total of the three entities,\n",
            "[3393.96s -> 3402.04s]  will you be able to exceed that initial target? And in the case of Toshiba, the source of growth\n",
            "[3402.04s -> 3408.36s]  is coming from the technology developed by R&D. And what is the source of the development and\n",
            "[3408.36s -> 3411.32s]  how are you going to separate that into three entities? Could you elaborate on that?\n",
            "[3412.12s -> 3419.08s]  I think answer is that the question is to talk about the growth potential. And as page 8 describes,\n",
            "[3419.08s -> 3426.92s]  there are three rectangles. And from left and right, relatively speaking, that these are\n",
            "[3426.92s -> 3432.92s]  considered shareholders where we are changing the entity structures and simplify the operation so\n",
            "[3432.92s -> 3439.72s]  that we can materialize the value and thereby providing more options for the shareholders.\n",
            "[3439.72s -> 3447.48s]  But in regard to the growth, the square in the middle where the forecast and agile management,\n",

            "[3454.60s -> 3460.36s]  and for example, as Mr. Hatazawa mentioned earlier, the power semiconductor to be growth,\n",
            "[3460.36s -> 3467.56s]  and then the investment into 300 millimeter was made. And that is something that I reflect upon\n",
            "[3467.56s -> 3476.52s]  now that semiconductor is in shortages nowadays. And in retrospect, probably a year before our\n",
            "[3476.52s -> 3483.08s]  decision, or at least six months before our actual decision, that investment had had to be made.\n",
            "[3483.08s -> 3487.48s]  But there were headquarters and the subsidiaries and there are the top executive meetings and\n",
            "[3487.48s -> 3493.64s]  others. And therefore, it took quite a long time to make final decisions. And in terms of agility,\n",
            "[3493.64s -> 3498.84s]  they are something that we have personally reflect upon. And therefore, looking at each market,\n",

            "[3505.80s -> 3513.48s]  look at and the focus and the very small management will have to make very agile decisions so that we\n",
            "[3513.48s -> 3517.96s]  can compete well in the global market. So that's why we decided to separate the entities in this\n",

            "[4622.92s -> 4630.20s]  and in this process, we could learn a lot from the engagement with shareholders,\n",
            "[4630.20s -> 4635.00s]  particularly in relation to governance. There are many things that we could learn.\n",
            "[4636.92s -> 4642.04s]  Irrespective of whether or not shareholders are activists or not, but this time in order to\n",
            "[4642.04s -> 4647.00s]  enhance the value of the company and to enhance the shareholders value, we believe that this was\n",
            "[4647.08s -> 4654.04s]  the right decision. Three years ago in 2018, Toshiba Next Plan was formulated. And at the time,\n",
            "[4654.04s -> 4662.04s]  the company's goal was to through maximization of corporate value, TSR, total shareholder return\n",
            "[4662.04s -> 4669.16s]  is to be enhanced. This is what we said. So TSR or shareholder value to be maximized. That was\n",
            "[4669.16s -> 4677.48s]  what we said. And this policy has not changed at all. And at this time, for the purpose of\n",
            "[4677.48s -> 4684.60s]  increasing the shareholder value or expanding the TSR, and this separation plan is very reasonable\n",
            "[4685.16s -> 4689.96s]  towards the future, we needed to make evolution, we believe that this is a\n",
            "[4689.96s -> 4692.76s]  very important one step towards that. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[4694.92s -> 4697.00s]  From Diamant, Senbogisan, please.\n",
            "[4697.48s -> 4702.36s]  From Diamant, my name is Senbongi speaking. On a related note, I would like to ask\n",
            "[4703.40s -> 4711.32s]  about the top management positions. And I do have several questions. Within the year,\n",
            "[4713.56s -> 4721.32s]  to find a successor and also the chair of the board meeting. And I understand that it will be\n",
            "[4721.32s -> 4725.40s]  difficult to find a successor within the calendar year. I would like to know whether that is correct\n",
            "[4725.72s -> 4736.12s]  and also why the reason. And perhaps Mr. Brough from the nomination committee or anyone who is\n",
            "[4736.12s -> 4741.80s]  suitable to answer. I hope that would be answered. And also my next question is about the separation\n",
            "[4741.80s -> 4750.12s]  plan into three entities, about the president, CEO and the, would that impact the finding the\n",
            "[4750.12s -> 4758.60s]  successor of the chairman and also when do you want to decide on the new management?\n",
            "[4761.72s -> 4766.44s]  So at the first question, we would like to ask Mr. Brough to,\n",
            "[4767.40s -> 4771.56s]  and please wait as we will be switching the image and also the line.\n",
            "[4771.80s -> 4782.60s]  With regard to the separation plan, we should be able to recruit and retain people with more\n",
            "[4782.60s -> 4787.96s]  specialist skills rather than the generalist skills that are needed to run a conglomerate.\n",
            "[4788.84s -> 4797.80s]  And once we have the support of our shareholders, we will be on a course to start recruiting people\n",
            "[4797.88s -> 4802.92s]  for our respective boards. But that's a little bit early in the day at the moment,\n",
            "[4802.92s -> 4809.88s]  but of course the intention is to have appropriately qualified boards with industry experience to run\n",
            "[4809.88s -> 4819.56s]  those two spinco businesses. I think beyond that, we are going to go to our shareholders for an EGM\n",
            "[4820.12s -> 4826.60s]  in March. I think once we've got that endorsement, we should be putting forward some more\n",

            "[4850.52s -> 4857.00s]  Excuse me. The EGM should be March and the translator mistakenly announced that it was May.\n",

            "[4870.52s -> 4878.52s]  that point and the reason. So, this time, there's much strategic options and we had this change in\n",

            "[4888.92s -> 4893.48s]  someone, so that was what was mentioned at the nomination committee. I am not a member of the\n",
            "[4893.48s -> 4898.84s]  nomination committee. I am a member of the board of directors. I am a member of the board of\n",
            "[4898.92s -> 4903.32s]  directors. I am not a member of the nomination committee. So, the first priority was placed\n",
            "[4903.32s -> 4909.32s]  on to creating and specify the separation plan. That was the priority.\n",
            "[4911.72s -> 4913.80s]  That was the supplementary explanation.\n",
            "[4918.04s -> 4920.28s]  So, we will move to the next question.\n",
            "[4922.12s -> 4924.60s]  Next, Takahashi-san of Toyo Keisai, please.\n",
            "[4925.56s -> 4931.80s]  Can you hear me? Yes, I hear you well. This is Takahashi of Toyo Keisai. Thank you very much for\n",
            "[4931.80s -> 4937.32s]  this opportunity. I would like to follow up the previous question. May I ask once again and\n",
            "[4937.32s -> 4947.32s]  confirm. Now, the chairperson of the company for your company, what is the selection process?\n",
            "[4948.20s -> 4953.80s]  Well, the question is that, Sunaka-san, are you going to serve as an interim chairperson until\n",
            "[4954.20s -> 4959.32s]  the separation of the companies? May I confirm once again? And I would like to ask another\n",
            "[4959.32s -> 4966.36s]  question at this juncture. The company will be separated into three entities. And the third one,\n",
            "[4966.36s -> 4971.80s]  which is considered to be the current Toshiba portion, that the Kiyokusha's stake will be\n",
            "[4971.80s -> 4976.92s]  owned and also Toshiba Tech's shareholder is going to be Toshiba. But do you think that\n",
            "[4976.92s -> 4982.68s]  Toshiba will disappear in the future? I just wonder what is the continuation or existence\n",
            "[4982.68s -> 4988.92s]  of Toshiba entity going forward. Regarding who will be the chairperson and CEO in the future,\n",
            "[4988.92s -> 4996.52s]  regarding that, outside directors are comprising the nomination committee. So, it is up to the\n",
            "[4996.52s -> 5002.04s]  nomination committee's decision. So, at this point in time, there's nothing that we know of.\n",
            "[5002.04s -> 5005.96s]  And therefore, it is up to the nomination committees to discuss going forward.\n",
            "[5005.96s -> 5013.40s]  Now, regarding what will happen that the legacy Toshiba, what would happen on that entity?\n",
            "[5013.40s -> 5021.00s]  Well, the Toshiba will own the ownership stake of Kiyokusha. And for Kiyokusha's ownership,\n",
            "[5021.00s -> 5026.12s]  we would like to monetize into the cash as soon as possible. And for Toshiba Tech,\n",
            "[5026.12s -> 5032.52s]  positioning is completely different. Well, Kiyokusha is equity method applicable company,\n",
            "[5032.52s -> 5037.32s]  and Toshiba Tech is fully consolidated listed subsidiary.\n",
            "[5041.80s -> 5046.04s]  What we call data business, for that, there's nothing decided at this point.\n",
            "[5046.84s -> 5052.44s]  We are working on digitalization at the data business, and Toshiba Tech owns many data,\n",
            "[5052.44s -> 5058.52s]  and Toshiba Tech's business is indispensable for Toshiba overall. So, what would happen for\n",
            "[5058.52s -> 5064.36s]  that entity? Currently, there are the heavy debt and also brand management issue as well.\n",
            "[5064.36s -> 5069.00s]  We need to discuss about the details going forward. So, that is the current situation.\n",
            "[5070.92s -> 5077.80s]  Thank you. Now, do you have clear pathways for divestitures and so forth? No, none. Are you\n",
            "[5077.80s -> 5083.16s]  asking about tech? Correct. The tech for the Toshiba Tech, nothing is decided.\n",
            "[5083.16s -> 5093.00s]  May I ask a further question? Relationship of the three entities, once these are spin-off,\n",
            "[5093.00s -> 5098.36s]  and it will be different independent entities. I'm not sure it is legally allowable or not. However,\n",
            "[5098.36s -> 5101.56s]  for example, cross-holding of the shares, for example, among the three entities,\n",
            "[5101.56s -> 5107.56s]  would that be a viable option? Under the laws and regulations in Japan, cross-shareholding of\n",
            "[5107.56s -> 5113.48s]  three entities is impossible. So, we will not have a cross-sharing of the shares. Thank you\n",
            "[5113.48s -> 5121.96s]  very much. Next, TV Tokyo, Abe-san, please. This is Abe of TV Tokyo. Can you hear me? Yes.\n",
            "[5125.80s -> 5129.40s]  In this press conference, the materials are titled\n",

            "[5138.28s -> 5145.32s]  And it used to be to enhance corporate value, but it has been changed to enhance shareholder value.\n",
            "[5145.32s -> 5155.16s]  Is it correct? I don't know. I'm not sure. The shareholder value should be enhanced. That\n",
            "[5155.24s -> 5161.64s]  was the word we finalized. And by maximizing corporate value, and then shareholder value\n",
            "[5161.64s -> 5168.60s]  will be also enhanced. So, in the end, ultimately, shareholder value will be enhanced. As the means\n",
            "[5168.60s -> 5174.92s]  to do that, and then corporate value should be increased, so TSR should be expanded. So,\n",
            "[5174.92s -> 5182.84s]  as the final point to reach, we wrote shareholder value. The reason why I ask this question,\n",
            "[5182.84s -> 5188.36s]  according to what I heard from the company's people and the current management team,\n",
            "[5189.48s -> 5194.68s]  maybe people are looking only towards the shareholders within the management team.\n",
            "[5194.68s -> 5199.16s]  And that is the criticism that we have heard from the people in the company, activists,\n",
            "[5199.16s -> 5206.28s]  so in particular, shareholders are considered most. And in preparation of this material,\n",
            "[5206.28s -> 5211.24s]  Tanakawa-san, you mentioned that there are a lot of discussions, management team and top\n",
            "[5211.24s -> 5218.20s]  executives of the subsidiaries and so forth. So, have you, I believe that there was only\n",
            "[5218.20s -> 5223.72s]  limited discussion with the top executives of the subsidiaries or operating companies, and it was\n",
            "[5223.72s -> 5228.84s]  out of the blue for them. Do you think that you have obtained understanding from the internal\n",
            "[5228.84s -> 5239.48s]  people about this plan? We have been continuing to say, since three years ago when Toshiba Next\n",
            "[5239.48s -> 5244.68s]  Plan was announced, and TSR should be enhanced, we have been keeping to say the same thing,\n",
            "[5244.68s -> 5250.44s]  but of course, shareholders, stakeholders, but of course, the society at large and employees,\n",
            "[5251.16s -> 5257.08s]  all the stakeholders should be valued. And this is our policy which has stayed unchanged. And this\n",
            "[5257.08s -> 5264.68s]  time again, we do not change this policy at all. By having this separation into three companies,\n",
            "[5264.68s -> 5268.84s]  and then we believe that we will be able to provide appropriate services to customers,\n",
            "[5268.84s -> 5274.20s]  and there will be incentives and various benefits and merits for employees as well,\n",
            "[5274.20s -> 5280.44s]  based upon the business cycle of each company after separation. And as a overall,\n",
            "[5281.32s -> 5286.20s]  for all the stakeholders, we believe that this decision is going to be the best option.\n",
            "[5290.84s -> 5297.64s]  Current shareholders will obtain the shares of the two standalone companies which will be listed\n",
            "[5297.64s -> 5305.88s]  on the market. Regarding the percentage, the mix or percentage of the shares to be allocated,\n",
            "[5305.88s -> 5312.84s]  do you think that this will be reflecting the current values? Well, I think that will be\n",
            "[5312.84s -> 5318.28s]  determined when the spin-off is completed. We do not have anything that has been clarified.\n",
            "[5319.48s -> 5327.40s]  Nothing clarified? Then the structure of the shareholding ownership structure is different,\n",
            "[5327.72s -> 5331.24s]  I think there will be an option for shareholders to choose.\n",
            "[5333.48s -> 5338.04s]  Based upon the same ratio, I think maybe I should defer this question to CFO.\n",
            "[5340.92s -> 5347.96s]  So in two years, sometime in two years from today, the ownership structure\n",
            "[5348.92s -> 5355.56s]  will be divided, I mean shares of the Toshiba held by shareholders will be\n",
            "[5356.76s -> 5364.76s]  divided and shareholders will be provided with the different shares in each company, each entity.\n",
            "[5364.76s -> 5370.76s]  So it will depend on the decision of shareholders regarding what to do with those allocated shares.\n",
            "[5371.72s -> 5380.12s]  And I think there is a uncertainty whether or not the company will be able to maintain R&D\n",
            "[5380.12s -> 5386.28s]  functions. For example, in the case of infrastructure company, infrastructure business and the QKD\n",
            "[5387.72s -> 5394.92s]  business, of course, quantum encryption, it will cost a lot of money in R&D activities.\n",
            "[5395.88s -> 5402.36s]  So after separating into two entities and research laboratories will be also divided into two.\n",
            "[5402.36s -> 5406.52s]  So do you think that you can you'll be able to maintain such capabilities,\n",
            "[5407.32s -> 5411.24s]  that Toshiba's cutting-edge technology can be really maintained?\n",
            "[5412.12s -> 5419.88s]  I think there needs to be more clearer forecast or outlook regarding this.\n",
            "[5420.36s -> 5427.64s]  Okay, I would like to defer to Hatazawa-san. Within the numbers we presented, CAPEX, R&D\n",
            "[5427.64s -> 5434.84s]  expenditures are explained for the coming three years. And according to the current plan,\n",
            "[5435.80s -> 5442.60s]  the growth plan to be supported by the growth funds, as you know, to be spent in the R&D\n",
            "[5443.56s -> 5451.56s]  and the CAPEX. So these are estimated to be more aggressively spent R&D expenditures.\n",
            "[5453.56s -> 5459.56s]  In addition to the ratio of R&D expenditure in the total sales, which has been increased by\n",
            "[5459.56s -> 5465.56s]  1% or 2% points. So overall, we are going to put more focus on the R&D.\n",
            "[5466.12s -> 5473.48s]  And in terms of division into device and infrastructure and contents of the research,\n",
            "[5474.04s -> 5480.52s]  it will depend on where in the business areas such activities can be allocated to. And then\n",
            "[5480.52s -> 5486.20s]  the expenditures or efforts will be divided. As Tsunakawa-san mentioned, and the basic research,\n",
            "[5487.00s -> 5491.48s]  we would like to avoid the R&D activities, which are the most expensive.\n",
            "[5492.44s -> 5496.20s]  And Tsunakawa-san mentioned, and the basic research, we would like to avoid the negative\n",
            "[5496.20s -> 5502.12s]  impact of the spin-off. We will consider that in the process of spin-off completion. And R&D\n",
            "[5502.12s -> 5507.88s]  is continues to be important for the company. So we will continue to be even more aggressive in\n",
            "[5507.88s -> 5515.64s]  spending in the R&D. Lastly, have you already reported this plan to METI? If so, what was the\n",
            "[5515.72s -> 5527.48s]  feedback? What was the reaction from METI? Yes, we went to explain this to them in advance. I\n",
            "[5527.48s -> 5531.72s]  don't think there was any negative feedback from them. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[5534.20s -> 5538.36s]  So it is about time. So we would like to take the last question. Nikkei Business,\n",
            "[5538.92s -> 5548.12s]  please. This is Kodachi from Nikkei Business. Do you hear me okay? Thank you. So I have three last\n",
            "[5548.12s -> 5556.44s]  questions. Two to Tsunakawa-san. So about the Kiyokusa shares. So in order to solve the excessive\n",
            "[5556.44s -> 5563.96s]  net operating loss, I believe that it was being used. So we have the device company.\n",
            "[5564.36s -> 5571.16s]  So I don't think you need to be desperate to sell the shares. And if you keep the shares\n",
            "[5571.16s -> 5577.40s]  in stake, perhaps you can see some energy. But are you still willing to determine to sell the\n",
            "[5577.40s -> 5584.52s]  stake? And the second one is about the separation plan. So I think this special resolution will be\n",
            "[5584.52s -> 5589.40s]  required at the AGM. But I think that the special resolution to be attained is going to be a very\n",
            "[5590.04s -> 5594.04s]  hard, high hurdle.\n",
            "[5595.00s -> 5602.68s]  So,\n",
            "[5610.04s -> 5610.68s]  and also,\n",
            "[5616.12s -> 5619.96s]  I believe that the split, the opinion is quite split.\n",
            "[5620.52s -> 5631.80s]  Is that is what I heard? Within the SRC. So why not sell to the PE fund, but this separation\n",
            "[5631.80s -> 5638.92s]  plan was supported? So could you reiterate the reason? Because I did not find in the explanation,\n",

            "[6100.92s -> 6108.84s]  I think that was the basis. So are you sure that this conglomerate discount can be resolved? So\n",
            "[6108.84s -> 6116.76s]  could you please give us your specific opinion? In fiscal year 2023, the operating income of\n",
            "[6116.76s -> 6122.84s]  200 billion yen, which is rather conservative, and infrastructure service ROIC is still 10%.\n",
            "[6123.80s -> 6131.08s]  I think earlier, infrastructure service will achieve 30%, infrastructure system 10%. So in\n",
            "[6131.08s -> 6138.52s]  total, at least 20% can be secured. So I think that there will be the improvement room. But\n",
            "[6138.84s -> 6145.08s]  after the split, and then 10% ROIC, and then do you think that the conglomerate discount can be\n",
            "[6145.08s -> 6151.24s]  really cleared or resolved? So this is my first question about your expectation on these points.\n",

            "[6179.48s -> 6185.64s]  As a result, the performance will be better. So it will lead to the resolution of the conglomerate\n",

            "[6240.28s -> 6246.04s]  the committed numbers. So that's why we came up with the conservative plan. And we are showing\n",
            "[6246.04s -> 6253.16s]  the plan for the coming three years alone. And in fiscal year 2024-25, we have a plan\n",

            "[6369.16s -> 6377.96s]  been saying. As Hattazawasan mentioned earlier, in 2021, this current fiscal year and this coming\n",
            "[6377.96s -> 6388.36s]  2022, in these years, we came up with this rather sure plan. Therefore, we will be able to achieve\n",
            "[6388.36s -> 6395.72s]  this net income number. So considering all these and according to our calculation, we'll be able to\n",
            "[6396.20s -> 6401.00s]  have a return in the order of about 100 billion yen to shareholders.\n",
            "[6402.68s -> 6409.96s]  So regarding the gains from the sale of Keoxia shares is outside of this number. And regarding\n",

            "[6489.40s -> 6498.36s]  I am sure that there was a lot of discussion on these matters. So the ideal state of Toshiba,\n",
            "[6499.16s -> 6507.56s]  what do you believe is the most ideal? I know that it could be something unrealistic. But could you\n",
            "[6508.12s -> 6513.48s]  explain about the ideal state of Toshiba? The reason I'm asking there are three reasons.\n",

            "[6548.52s -> 6556.60s]  the three part is that the USGE also have decided the separation. So I believe that separation\n",
            "[6556.60s -> 6562.44s]  spin-off is now being questioned. And this is something beyond shareholders. So what is the\n",
            "[6562.44s -> 6569.48s]  significance, meaning of separation? I understand being agile, that is one of the advantage. But\n",
            "[6569.56s -> 6579.24s]  also, this has been said from the early 2000s. And so why now today separation spin-off is being\n",
            "[6579.24s -> 6588.28s]  decided? Does that reflect something in society? So these are my questions. I would like to respond.\n",
            "[6588.84s -> 6596.12s]  And if any of the two of my colleagues have anything to add. So what is the ideal state?\n",
            "[6596.36s -> 6603.16s]  States. So I know that this will differ. But for myself, when we have a business,\n",
            "[6604.04s -> 6610.28s]  and we are trying to solve the social issues around us, and it that is what is happening\n",

            "[6619.72s -> 6627.40s]  where I am particular about. Well, medical, Toshiba Medical, some went to kind of medical\n",
            "[6627.40s -> 6635.24s]  and would this give it a COVID situation? And MRI, for example, they are very well,\n",
            "[6635.88s -> 6643.16s]  and well positioned in Japan globally, which is very... And although I'm sad that Toshiba name\n",
            "[6643.16s -> 6650.44s]  is gone. But what I have done is contributing society and seeing it growing, that itself\n",
            "[6650.44s -> 6656.68s]  makes me very happy. So in the same sense, in the same note, that what we are doing in our business,\n",

            "[5284.68s -> 5296.28s]  going to be the best option. Current shareholders will obtain the shares of the two standalone\n",
            "[5296.28s -> 5303.80s]  companies which will be listed on the market. Regarding the percentage, the mix or percentage\n",

            "[5317.08s -> 5325.40s]  that has been clarified. Nothing clarified? Then the structure of the shareholding ownership\n",

            "[5339.88s -> 5347.96s]  So in two years, sometime in two years from today, the ownership structure\n",
            "[5351.16s -> 5355.56s]  will be divided. I mean shares of the Toshiba held by shareholders will be\n",
            "[5356.76s -> 5364.68s]  divided and shareholders will be provided with the different shares in each company, each entity.\n",
            "[5364.68s -> 5370.68s]  So it will depend on the decision of shareholders regarding what to do with those allocated shares.\n",
            "[5374.04s -> 5382.44s]  And I think there is an uncertainty whether or not the company will be able to maintain R&D\n",
            "[5382.44s -> 5388.92s]  functions. For example in the case of infrastructure company, infrastructure business and the QKD\n",
            "[5389.48s -> 5396.20s]  business, of course quantum encryption, it will cost a lot of money in R&D activities.\n",

            "[5404.44s -> 5408.44s]  So do you think that you can you'll be able to maintain such capabilities,\n",
            "[5409.24s -> 5416.28s]  that Toshiba's cutting-edge technology can be really maintained? I think there needs to be\n",
            "[5416.92s -> 5421.32s]  more clearer forecast or outlook regarding this.\n",
            "[5424.92s -> 5430.12s]  Okay I would like to defer to Hatazawa-san. Within the numbers we presented,\n",
            "[5430.12s -> 5435.88s]  CAPEX R&D expenditures are explained for the coming three years.\n",
            "[5437.96s -> 5444.76s]  And according to the current plan, the growth plan to be supported by the growth funds as you know\n",
            "[5445.32s -> 5454.92s]  to be spent in the R&D and the CAPEX. So these are estimated to be more aggressively spent\n",
            "[5456.12s -> 5464.28s]  R&D expenditures. In addition to the ratio of R&D expenditure in the total sales, which has\n",
            "[5464.28s -> 5469.96s]  been increased by one percent or two percent points. So overall we are going to put more focus\n",
            "[5469.96s -> 5481.48s]  on the R&D. And in terms of division into device and infrastructure and contents of the research,\n",
            "[5481.48s -> 5488.04s]  it will depend on where in the business areas such activities can be allocated to. And then\n",
            "[5488.04s -> 5493.88s]  the expenditures or efforts will be divided. As Tsunakawa-san mentioned and the basic research,\n",
            "[5494.68s -> 5499.40s]  we would like to avoid a negative impact of the spin-off. We will consider that in the process\n",
            "[5499.40s -> 5506.12s]  of spin-off completion. And R&D continues to be important for the company. So we will continue to\n",
            "[5506.12s -> 5513.64s]  be even more aggressive in spending in the R&D. Lastly, have you already reported this plan to\n",
            "[5513.64s -> 5518.20s]  METI? If so, what was the feedback? What was the reaction from METI?\n",
            "[5518.20s -> 5530.04s]  Yes. We went to explain this to them in advance. I don't think there was any negative feedback from them.\n",
            "[5530.04s -> 5531.64s]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[5531.64s -> 5539.08s]  So it is about time. So we would like to take the last question. Nikkei Business. Kodachan, please.\n",
            "[5539.40s -> 5545.96s]  This is Kodachan from Nikkei Business. Do you hear me okay? Thank you. So I have three last questions.\n",
            "[5545.96s -> 5553.88s]  Two to Tsunakawa-san. So about the Kiyokusa shares. So in order to solve the excessive\n",
            "[5553.88s -> 5561.64s]  net operating loss, I believe that it was being used. So we have the device company.\n",
            "[5562.20s -> 5572.92s]  So I don't think you need to be desperate to sell the shares. And if you keep the shares in stake,\n",
            "[5572.92s -> 5579.00s]  perhaps you can save some energy. But are you still willing to determine to sell the stake?\n",
            "[5579.00s -> 5586.04s]  And the second one is about the separation plan. So I think this special resolution will be required\n",
            "[5586.04s -> 5590.36s]  at the AGM. But I think that the special resolution to be attained is going to be a very\n",
            "[5591.32s -> 5593.40s]  hard, high hurdle.\n",
            "[5610.04s -> 5610.68s]  And also,\n",
            "[5611.48s -> 5615.48s]  I believe that the split, the opinion is quite split.\n",
            "[5617.72s -> 5629.08s]  Is that is what I heard? Within the SRC, so why not sell to the PE fund, but this separation\n",
            "[5629.08s -> 5636.68s]  plan was supported? So could you reiterate the reason? Because I did not find and the expense\n",
            "[5636.68s -> 5642.92s]  So could you could that be answered? So myself, Tsunakawa, about these Kiyokusa stake shares.\n",
            "[5644.04s -> 5650.44s]  So why not seek synergy with the semiconductor business? Memory business will require massive\n",
            "[5650.44s -> 5659.08s]  investment. And even with the current financial position, we have decided no longer to continue.\n",
            "[5659.48s -> 5665.96s]  And so instead to monetize the stake. So that has been already decided from before. And there is no\n",
            "[5665.96s -> 5673.48s]  change to this policy. And about the two third special resolution 2023. So until that point,\n",
            "[5676.60s -> 5685.08s]  as I mentioned earlier, this reform is just the beginning. And it is sort of a declaration\n",
            "[5685.16s -> 5690.84s]  It's just the beginning. And it is sort of a declaration. And so in the meantime,\n",
            "[5691.72s -> 5697.32s]  there will be further reform that is going to come and will be executed also capital policy\n",
            "[5697.32s -> 5703.00s]  as well. And also for the shareholders, that we will be endorsed and be supported,\n",
            "[5703.00s -> 5709.32s]  we will make the effort. And Mr. Brough, could you respond, please?\n",
            "[5710.28s -> 5717.24s]  The SRC's letter to shareholders, which was published this afternoon, goes into some detail\n",
            "[5717.24s -> 5723.64s]  about the process we followed with regard to private equity. It was quite an exhaustive process,\n",
            "[5724.44s -> 5732.20s]  going through several rounds with credible buyers. And at the end of the day, the separation plan\n",
            "[5732.84s -> 5739.56s]  came about principally because of the difficulty in valuing the Keoxia shares at this time.\n",
            "[5740.44s -> 5749.00s]  And the separation plan was therefore regarded as superior to the private equity plan from a\n",
            "[5749.00s -> 5756.44s]  quantitative and qualitative aspect. So if you like, the separation plan emerged from our earlier\n",
            "[5756.44s -> 5763.08s]  discussions with regard to the management plan, with regard to possible minority investors,\n",
            "[5763.08s -> 5767.72s]  and with regard to private equity solutions. That's how it came about. Thank you.\n",
            "[5777.08s -> 5782.12s]  Did I answer your question? Now we'd like to close the sessions for the media.\n",
            "[5782.84s -> 5792.04s]  Next, we'd like to invite the SOSAT analysts and financial institutions to take up some questions.\n",
            "[5792.04s -> 5795.08s]  So those of you who were not picked up by the questionnaire,\n",

            "[5840.76s -> 5848.20s]  concluded that the spin-off is a correct option. But in terms of the divestitures compared to\n",
            "[5848.20s -> 5855.80s]  spin-off, well, compared to the divestitures versus spin-off, why did you conclude that spin-off\n",
            "[5855.80s -> 5862.52s]  generates the larger upsides in the company's shareholder's value? And what is the benefit of\n",
            "[5862.52s -> 5867.00s]  having split? So could you elaborate on that specifically? That is the first question.\n",
            "[5867.00s -> 5872.76s]  Second question is pertaining to the presentation by Tanakawa-san at the outset that business\n",

            "[5887.08s -> 5892.44s]  of how Toshiba would be like in the future? I think it would be beyond what you have decided\n",
            "[5892.44s -> 5899.88s]  on in two years' time, beyond that, as a result of the spin-off. Do you think that a complete\n",
            "[5899.88s -> 5904.60s]  and separate industry entity would be ultimate form of the company, or do you see further\n",
            "[5904.60s -> 5911.40s]  realignment of the company? Do you have any visions beyond two years' time? Now, question\n",
            "[5911.40s -> 5917.16s]  one and two, I think some parts are interlinked. So at the beginning in the medium-term plan,\n",
            "[5918.60s -> 5924.20s]  inclusive non-core and core, it is true that the management has discussed about possible\n",
            "[5924.20s -> 5931.48s]  segregation of the core and non-core, but we tried to focus on what the company's layout would be in\n",
            "[5931.48s -> 5937.56s]  the near future. So that was the focal point this time. And therefore, the identifying core versus\n",
            "[5937.56s -> 5943.08s]  non-core, that is actually on the ongoing discussion at this moment as well, and we will\n",
            "[5943.08s -> 5948.28s]  continue that discussion going forward as well. So what we have announced this time is just a\n",
            "[5948.28s -> 5955.24s]  starting point of improving the value going forward. So there will be two new core, and as\n",
            "[5955.24s -> 5963.08s]  soon as possible, they will prepare the business plan on their own, and we'd like to provide\n",

            "[5968.36s -> 5974.76s]  Going back to the first question, what is the strength and what was the advantage of the split\n",
            "[5974.76s -> 5982.92s]  idea versus the divestitures? There are three squares in the previous presentations, and I am\n",

            "[5990.76s -> 5996.92s]  and that is the main theme in my opinion. And therefore, focused and agile business management\n",
            "[5996.92s -> 6003.96s]  is the very important point in my view. Sorry, I'm talking too long, but in retrospect,\n",
            "[6003.96s -> 6009.72s]  I've been serving as CEO and COO for a very long time for this company, and what I remorse about\n",
            "[6009.72s -> 6016.36s]  is that we were not able to exercise the growth strategy properly. So at the right timing,\n",
            "[6016.36s -> 6020.76s]  we'd like to make an investment at the appropriate timing. We'd like to be very agile,\n",

            "[6081.32s -> 6091.24s]  I have two questions. First question is through separation to unlock value. What is the concrete\n",
            "[6091.88s -> 6098.52s]  value? What is the concrete image of unlocking value through spin-off? Conglomerate discount\n",
            "[6098.52s -> 6107.88s]  will be resolved. I think that was the basis. So are you sure that this conglomerate discount\n",

            "[6144.92s -> 6150.92s]  be really cleared or resolved? So this is my first question about your expectation on these\n",
            "[6150.92s -> 6157.72s]  points. Okay. I would like to respond first, and I would like to ask Hatazawa-san to supplement.\n",
            "[6158.60s -> 6167.16s]  And this time, unlocking the value. This is the headline, but the purpose itself is not to resolve\n",
            "[6168.20s -> 6173.96s]  the conglomerate discount. We needed to clarify the structure so that each individual standalone\n",
            "[6173.96s -> 6179.48s]  company will be able to manage their business respectively in an easy to understand manner.\n",
            "[6179.48s -> 6185.64s]  As a result, the performance will be better. So it will lead to the resolution of the conglomerate\n",
            "[6185.64s -> 6193.08s]  discount. This is what I am feeling. Regarding numbers, I said earlier,\n",
            "[6195.24s -> 6203.48s]  the numbers that can be achievable, because we have been pointed out about the lack of\n",
            "[6203.56s -> 6209.64s]  achieving whatever commitment we have been making in the past. So there was the criticism from the\n",
            "[6210.44s -> 6215.80s]  sources on the market. So that's why we came up with these numbers, which seem to be sure to be\n",
            "[6215.80s -> 6227.08s]  achieved. Hatazawa is going to supplement. And in 2025 and towards 2030, we presented a plan towards\n",
            "[6227.08s -> 6234.52s]  those years. And internally, we have that forecast or targets for 2025. And based upon the opinion\n",
            "[6234.52s -> 6242.92s]  from external parties, we were asked to secure the delivery on the committed numbers. So that's why\n",
            "[6242.92s -> 6248.36s]  we came up with the conservative plan. And we are showing the plan for the coming three years alone.\n",
            "[6249.32s -> 6258.84s]  And in fiscal year 2024-25, we have a plan inside the company. I would like to disclose those plans\n",
            "[6258.84s -> 6267.16s]  at the appropriate opportunity. And we talked about the importance of investing in R&D activities.\n",
            "[6267.16s -> 6271.08s]  And the results will be realised in fiscal year 2024 and 2025.\n",
            "[6271.88s -> 6277.08s]  And external parties, particularly listening to the voices of shareholders, and within the short\n",

            "[6283.72s -> 6288.84s]  in the short term, it should be presented. So you may think that these numbers seem to be a little\n",
            "[6288.84s -> 6295.40s]  weak, but I'm sorry, that was the basis for coming up with this number. And we wanted to incorporate\n",
            "[6296.12s -> 6303.00s]  some risk buffers. So that's why we came up with this plan. That's all. Thank you.\n",
            "[6303.80s -> 6310.60s]  Thank you very much. My second question is for CFO. In the coming two years,\n",
            "[6311.72s -> 6321.56s]  share buyback in the level of 100 billion yen, you said, and is it related to the sale of the\n",
            "[6321.56s -> 6331.08s]  shares in Keoxia or it is not included in the buyback plan and utilising NOL? And then what\n",
            "[6331.08s -> 6341.96s]  will be the advantage, benefits of the tax issues at the time of a sale? So, qualitative comment\n",
            "[6341.96s -> 6347.96s]  will be okay. So could you please give us your comment? Thank you very much for your question.\n",
            "[6348.92s -> 6359.96s]  Regarding your first question, as Mr. Kusunokawa mentioned, at our company, we have a yardstick\n",
            "[6359.96s -> 6366.68s]  of so-called appropriate level of capital. So capital exceeding that appropriate level will\n",
            "[6366.68s -> 6371.96s]  be returned to shareholders. That's what we have been saying. As Hatazawa-san mentioned earlier,\n",
            "[6372.12s -> 6380.52s]  in 2021, this current fiscal year and this coming 2022, in these years,\n",
            "[6382.28s -> 6389.56s]  we came up with this rather short plan. Therefore, we will be able to achieve this net income\n",
            "[6390.28s -> 6395.72s]  number. So considering all these and according to our calculation, we will be able to\n",
            "[6396.20s -> 6401.08s]  have a return in the order of about 100 billion yen to shareholders.\n",
            "[6402.76s -> 6410.04s]  So regarding the gains from the sale of Keoxia shares is outside of this number. And regarding\n",
            "[6410.04s -> 6419.72s]  the NOL, net operating loss, as you know, according to the tax law for the current fiscal year,\n",
            "[6420.44s -> 6427.88s]  half of the amount recorded in the current fiscal year can be utilised. So based on the balance sheet,\n",
            "[6427.88s -> 6438.84s]  there is an NOL in the amount of about 300 billion yen. So how and when Keoxia stake in Keoxia can\n",
            "[6438.84s -> 6447.64s]  be sold at any point? So if at that time, if we still have the NOL, and then about half of the\n",
            "[6447.64s -> 6453.72s]  gains obtained through the sale of Keoxia shares will be offset by the NOL. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[6453.72s -> 6462.20s]  Understood. Thank you. Next, UBS. Yes, Mutsumo, please.\n",
            "[6465.00s -> 6469.08s]  Thank you. UBS, this is Yese speaking. Yes, we hear you.\n",
            "[6469.56s -> 6476.84s]  I have one question. But there are three aims in asking my one question.\n",
            "[6479.48s -> 6489.08s]  So this announcement about how management is done, also how the business exists, I am sure that there\n",
            "[6489.40s -> 6501.88s]  was a lot of discussion on these matters. So the ideal state of Toshiba, what do you believe is the most ideal?\n",
            "[6502.68s -> 6510.92s]  I know that it could be something unrealistic. But could you explain about the ideal state of Toshiba?\n",
            "[6510.92s -> 6518.76s]  The reason I am asking, there are three reasons. What do you think the issue of Toshiba is?\n",
            "[6519.24s -> 6529.24s]  And the process, not how you have reflected, but if there is anything, an event that has led you to\n",
            "[6529.24s -> 6538.60s]  the process. And also, second part is that when selecting the management of the new separated\n",
            "[6538.60s -> 6546.52s]  company, when you want to hand over to the new management, what is your ambition? What is your hope\n",
            "[6546.52s -> 6553.00s]  that the new management to realise? And also the three part is that the USGE also have decided\n",
            "[6553.56s -> 6560.52s]  the separation. So I believe that separation spin-off is now being questioned. And this is\n",
            "[6560.52s -> 6567.64s]  something beyond shareholders. So what is the significance, meaning of separation? I understand\n",
            "[6567.64s -> 6574.76s]  being agile, that is one of the advantage. But also, this has been said from the early 2000s.\n",
            "[6574.76s -> 6583.88s]  And so why now today separation spin-off is being decided? Does that reflect something in society?\n",
            "[6583.88s -> 6593.88s]  So these are my questions. I would like to respond. And if any of the two of my colleagues have\n",
            "[6593.88s -> 6600.36s]  anything to add. So what is the ideal state? So I know that this will differ. But for myself,\n",
            "[6601.00s -> 6606.92s]  when we have a business, and we are trying to solve the social issues around us, and\n",
            "[6607.96s -> 6613.00s]  that is what is happening on a daily basis and the repetition. Personally,\n",
            "[6614.92s -> 6622.12s]  the company brand, that is nothing, that is not where I am particular about. Well, medical,\n",
            "[6622.20s -> 6630.28s]  medical, some went to kind of medical and would this give it a COVID situation.\n",
            "[6631.80s -> 6639.00s]  And MRI, for example, they are very well and well positioned in Japan globally, which is very\n",
            "[6640.84s -> 6648.12s]  and although I'm sad that Toshiba name is gone. But what I have done is contributing society and\n",
            "[6648.12s -> 6654.68s]  seeing it growing, that itself makes me very happy. So in the same sense, in the same notes,\n",
            "[6654.68s -> 6660.68s]  that what we are doing in our business, that our employees being satisfied, and also contributing\n",
            "[6660.68s -> 6668.12s]  to society, I think that is the ideal way, ideal state. So even in the form that it is split into\n",
            "[6668.12s -> 6675.80s]  two or more with the name changes, but our mission itself, how we execute and realize the mission,\n",
            "[6675.80s -> 6681.16s]  I think that is the important part. And so I was questioning myself, what is the ideal state? I\n",
            "[6681.16s -> 6689.00s]  know that I'm talking a lot. So perhaps this will be my response. And also, so as what I expect\n",
            "[6689.00s -> 6698.36s]  towards the future management, especially the largest issue is governance. So when it comes\n",
            "[6698.36s -> 6704.92s]  to governance, this is going to be the fundamentals in management. And governance, it has a committee\n",
            "[6704.92s -> 6712.12s]  has pointed out that although it may take some time that we want to reconstruct the governance,\n",
            "[6712.12s -> 6719.88s]  and also with a new company management, there was a mention about what type is suitable. And\n",
            "[6720.60s -> 6728.20s]  it is mentioned sometimes we will see talent from the outside of the market and also something with\n",
            "[6728.20s -> 6733.48s]  the capability of the governance perspective that is going to be some of the basics requirements,\n",
            "[6734.44s -> 6741.96s]  qualifications. And it was just by chance that GE also announced that Nikkei-Tlik, with that,\n",
            "[6741.96s -> 6749.48s]  we were a little earlier in with our scheme to be known. I don't know if this answers Yesi-Sen's\n",
            "[6749.48s -> 6752.36s]  question, but that is my impression. Do you have anything to add?\n",
            "[6754.76s -> 6761.00s]  As I also responding, I think that what each individual will be answering will be different.\n",
            "[6761.00s -> 6762.84s]  So this is my personal view.\n",
            "[6765.56s -> 6774.36s]  Myself, I believe that Toshiba's mission and philosophy is that what is asked for by Toshiba,\n",
            "[6774.36s -> 6777.96s]  and we have the responsibility to execute our responsibility.\n",
            "[6777.96s -> 6782.28s]  So that is what we are required of. And that is the reason of existence.\n",
            "[6782.52s -> 6789.00s]  So that is one thing. On the other hand, what clients, customers request us, sometimes the\n",
            "[6789.00s -> 6796.04s]  time is different and also the requirement is different, meaning that sometimes we cannot make\n",
            "[6797.00s -> 6802.28s]  a management decision which has been pointed out as an issue. I think this applies to GE.\n",
            "[6802.84s -> 6809.00s]  The management environment has changed. Speed is required. So not lag at time,\n",
            "[6809.24s -> 6816.44s]  in the past, with a lot of things mixtured in between, we will not be able to catch up and we\n",
            "[6816.44s -> 6823.24s]  cannot make a pure decision in order to survive. So that is why I believe that spinoff or separation\n",
            "[6823.80s -> 6830.76s]  could be one of the trend. We have the infrastructure, energy, and serve the clients\n",
            "[6830.76s -> 6837.32s]  in this industry, and we believe that Toshiba may have only the answer. And we believe that\n",
            "[6837.40s -> 6844.12s]  Toshiba may have only the answer for the device and disk, and also for the future information\n",
            "[6844.12s -> 6851.88s]  society. What is required of Toshiba? We need to create the solutions in a quickly manner that is\n",
            "[6851.88s -> 6858.20s]  requested by our clients. I think that is what we exist for, and that is the reasoning for why\n",
            "[6858.20s -> 6861.32s]  I decided on this decision, and also it matches the needs.\n",
            "[6865.08s -> 6871.96s]  Also, let me also say a few words. From a financial position perspective,\n",
            "[6873.08s -> 6882.44s]  from a shareholder, we have the equity and also we want to steadily increase the value. That is\n",
            "[6882.44s -> 6891.16s]  also the mission of the company. For this to happen, as Hadadar-san mentioned, we need to\n",
            "[6891.16s -> 6897.00s]  win the trust of our clients' customers, and also we have to deliver the products and services that\n",
            "[6897.00s -> 6903.96s]  is required of. And what is most important is that the employees also share the same mission,\n",
            "[6903.96s -> 6910.76s]  look at the same direction, be aligned in the same mission. So eventually that will lead to\n",
            "[6910.76s -> 6913.72s]  increase the value for the shareholders and unlock the values.\n",
            "[6916.44s -> 6922.12s]  There are various means to realize this, and given the current situation of Toshiba,\n",
            "[6923.00s -> 6930.44s]  what we have been discussing and what we are trying to execute, this framework is going to\n",
            "[6931.24s -> 6936.76s]  be the best path forward for the shareholders. I personally believe so strongly. Thank you.\n",
            "[6941.72s -> 6942.68s]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[6945.96s -> 6950.04s]  Next, we would like to invite from Goldman Sachs Mr. Harada, please.\n",
            "[6952.84s -> 6958.60s]  This is Harada speaking from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. Can you all hear me? Thank you.\n",
            "[6959.48s -> 6966.44s]  Now, I would like to ask one question. Now, my question may sound very similar to the previous\n",
            "[6966.44s -> 6972.60s]  questions. Now, influx services and device that you are going to separate into, an influence\n",
            "[6972.60s -> 6979.96s]  services company itself is considered a conglomerate in my opinion when you look at the business\n",
            "[6979.96s -> 6986.44s]  structure on a global basis. For example, elevators could be the vestiges going forward\n",
            "[6986.44s -> 6995.16s]  or carved out going forward. Do you think that further realignment of military services in scope\n",
            "[6995.16s -> 7001.24s]  or in your vision at this point? And in addition, there are many conglomerate-based companies in\n",
            "[7001.24s -> 7008.20s]  Japan, be it good or bad, your company is having a good connection with METI.\n",
            "[7009.96s -> 7016.60s]  Then, in order to enhance competitiveness of the overall corporate Japan, perhaps the realignment\n",
            "[7016.60s -> 7022.36s]  of the companies involving whole corporate society in Japan is perhaps is considered.\n",
            "[7022.36s -> 7027.08s]  Was that a part of the discussion with them? And also, being a part of the concept on the\n",
            "[7027.08s -> 7031.64s]  side of the senior management, would that be also something that you would consider\n",
            "[7032.52s -> 7037.80s]  if a good opportunity arises? Are you conscious of this type of operation or opportunity?\n",
            "[7039.64s -> 7045.56s]  So, infrastructure company, there are a variety of businesses included. However, there are some\n",
            "[7045.56s -> 7052.76s]  common denominators. For example, be it services and subscription models and it is quite a high\n",
            "[7052.76s -> 7057.80s]  potential of sharing the commonality across the different businesses in infrastructure services.\n",
            "[7057.80s -> 7063.32s]  But like I mentioned earlier, portfolio review exercise will continue and there is nothing that\n",
            "[7063.32s -> 7068.52s]  we have decided at this point in time and yet we would like to continue to discuss going forward.\n",
            "[7069.48s -> 7078.68s]  Now, regarding the realignment of industries in Japan, my position is at least that we reviewed\n",
            "[7078.68s -> 7085.88s]  all possible opportunities and options exhaustively. Think about all the stakeholders such as shareholder,\n",
            "[7085.88s -> 7091.24s]  employees and society, large customers and we would like to review from that point of view.\n",
            "[7091.24s -> 7096.84s]  That is my position. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your comment. That is all.\n",
            "[7099.08s -> 7105.72s]  Thank you very much. Now, we would like to entertain one last question at this point in time.\n",
            "[7105.72s -> 7111.96s]  SBI, Itsumi-san, please. Thank you very much. I have two questions\n",
            "[7113.16s -> 7121.56s]  regarding spin-off to list span of companies on the market. I am not experienced in this\n",
            "[7121.56s -> 7130.36s]  area. So, could you please give us timeline for new calls including their balance sheets?\n",
            "[7131.80s -> 7139.08s]  The treatment of such accounting will be starting from the third quarter of this fiscal year 2021\n",
            "[7139.08s -> 7143.24s]  and then in two years from today, a spin-off will be completed.\n",
            "[7143.48s -> 7152.20s]  This is my understanding. Is this correct? And the second question is about the company names\n",
            "[7152.20s -> 7161.96s]  of the new calls. Do you plan to name with Toshiba in the company's name like Kyokusha or other?\n",
            "[7161.96s -> 7168.76s]  I think that in this scheme, I think the new company's name would be like the ones as Kyokusha.\n",
            "[7169.24s -> 7178.36s]  Yes. Regarding the timeline, for the companies to be listed on the market, there needs to be\n",
            "[7178.36s -> 7185.00s]  a two fiscal year financial results to be audited. So, therefore, our target is in the second half\n",
            "[7185.00s -> 7191.40s]  of fiscal year 2023. Hirata-san will supplement and regarding the company names, there is nothing\n",
