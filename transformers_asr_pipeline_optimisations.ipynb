              "{'text': \" Now, it's time. May I start the presentation on Transforming Toshi Bata Enhanced Heroes Value and FY21 Second Quarter Consulated Business Results. We are organizing this presentation on online basis. From 4 to 5 o'clock, we will be presenting from our side and followed by 30 minutes question session for the middle of the media. The questions from Alice and investors will be accepted from 5.30 to 6 o'clock Japan time. Please be aware of that. Now, we will be collecting questions via telephone conferencing system. As is informed to you beforehand, the conference call system will require the pre-registration beforehand. Let me introduce the presenter today. President NCEO, Satoshi Tsunakawa. Corporate Senior Executive Vice President, Mamoru Hatazawa. Representative Jesus Officer, Corporate Executive Vice President, N C F O, Masayoshi Hirata. We have a chairperson of the strategic review committee outside director, Paul Broth. He is joining from Hong Kong online. My name is Hara of Corporate Communication Department. We are providing simultaneous transition, so if you are watching the live streaming in Japanese, you will be able to hear translation's voice. Please be aware of that. First, before going into Transforming Toshiba to enhance your host value, may I have Mr. Tanaka to see a few words upon the receipt of the report from the governance enhancement committee today. Mr. Senakawa, please. Now, first of all, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the company upon the report of the Government and Assessment Committee. First off, I would like to express profound appreciation to the members of the Government and Medicine Committee who have made tremendous efforts and time since their appointment to investigate the root codes of issue and raised in the investigation report, collodify where the response was utilized and compile recommendations for formulating the major's revenge recurrence. I recognize that the Toshiba's Government Assessment Committee, based on the strong belief that restructuring of the governance is essential for the revival of the Toshiba, has compiled a report for our future. In fact, no issue of illegality was discovered according to the report of the Government Enhancement Committee. Having said that, I feel as a part of the senior management of the company, I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the senior members of the company. I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the senior members of the company and their actions was concluded that an act as a whole violates the corporate ethics demanded by the market. We have just received a final report of the governance enhanced committee, but we will continue to discuss the governance seriously within the company based on the contents of the report, including recommendations for the formulation of the recurrence prevention measures. We believe that this recurrence prevention measures will form the very first step to restore the trust of the shareholders which have been restored so far. Now, one of the group's philosophy is doing the right thing. Many employees on the front lines of operations are working day to day based on this value. On the other hand, I believe that some of the members of the Single Management were acted quite differently from this velocity and that should be sincerely remorzed over. The Corporate Management is established based on the trust relationship with all stakeholders, the Government and Assessment Committee also pointed out that the importance of top at the tone and organizational leaders demonstrating their commitment to value ethics and integrity. Until now, the culture to recognize the mistakes and the very good communication so that anyone can raise opinions escalated to the higher level, but also we need to ensure the psychological safety of all employees. We will make persistent efforts in this regard. As I will announce today, our group decided to separate the energy infrastructure, business and storage device businesses that, they will be separate companies and aim for the IPOs independently. This is a draft exchange, but because these businesses will be separated and being independent. And therefore, the committed to people and committed to the future based on this philosophy under the new corporate culture, each business is poised to grow and this is a great opportunity. But beforehand, it is a critical mission of the Singapore government to enhance governance beforehand. It is a critical mission of the senior management to enhance governance beforehand. I appreciate your continued support and asking for your cooperation. Thank you very much. Next, we'd like to present on the transforming Toshiba to enhance Ashihori's value and Mr. Tuna Kawa will make presentations. Next, I'd like to explain on our new management policy titled, Transforming Toshi Bato Enhanced Childers Value. The corporate executive vice president, Hata Zawa, will also be presenting and also online, chairperson of the strategic Review Committee, Mr. Paul, will also be attending as well. Now, today, Toshiba Group has decided on its significant transformation to further refort for the future. Let me first introduce why this is the best path forward for Toshiba and our shareholders and what it means for our business going forward. And then we would like to invite Mr. Braff to explain on the evaluation made by the Strategic Review Committee. After that, Mr. Hadada will talk on what the business outlook will be. The that I'd like to explain. Now, at the Board of Directors Meeting held this morning, the decision was made for Toshiba's strategic reorganization to separate the businesses into two businesses as a result. There will be three standalone companies to be formulated. One is Insta-sexual service company, second is Device Company, and the third is Toshiba. As we conclude this strategic reorganization to be the best path forward for Toshiba and their stakeholders, we took into account the view of our important stakeholders and other stakeholders, as well as the business characteristics and the value chain of each of our diverse businesses. Over our history of over 140 years, Toshiba has constantly evolved to stay ahead of the times. Today's announcement is no different. Toshiba has built a portfolio of leading businesses, but in order to enhance our competitive positioning, each business needs greater flexibility to address its own market opportunities and challenges. The official names for the new companies will be announced in due course. Here is an overview of the three independent businesses. Infrastructure Service Company will consist of Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions, infrastructure systems and solutions, building solutions, digital solutions, and battery businesses, and become a company with the forecasted net sales of 2.1 trillion according to the fiscal year's forecast. Its increased focus combined with its innovative technological solutions will enable it to play a lean role in driving the transition to renewable energy to meet ambitious global carbon neutrality goals and advancing infrastructure resilience as a leading player. Device company will be comprised of the Toshiba electric device and storage solutions business and become accompanied with forecasted net sales of 870 billion yen. Its products will be including powers and conductors, high-capacity, hard disk drives, HDD for data centers, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It will be a global leader in supporting the evolution of social and IT infrastructure. Toshiba will continue to hold the companies on ownership stake in Kyokshia holding cooperation and Toshiba tech cooperation. Toshiba will seek to monetize the share of Kyokshia at an appropriate timing. The separation, this time, enables us to better align each new company by its unique business characteristics. Infantasture service company really did business focus on the direct sale of equipment and the provision of solutions to specific customers. It has long business cycles that are more heavily dependent on negotiations between business parties than the market conditions at large. In addition, it will be a capital-light business, and there are also major differences to the extent in which we conduct customized production. In contrast, device companies primarily manufactures and sells devices such as semiconductors and other materials, its business cycles are shorter and can be impacted significantly by the market conditions. It will be a capital intensive business that requires scale of continuous production across multiple customer orders and relatively speaking, the large capital investment needs to be made in a very flexible manner. So objective of a spin-off, there are three reasons. First, the separation will unlock immense value by removing complexity. Second, it enables us to have a much more focused and agile decision-making and their management. And the third separation naturally enhances choices for our shareholders. Our board and management team firmly believe that the strategic reorganization is the right step for sustainable profitable growth for each of the businesses and the best path to create additional value for our stakeholders. For our shareholders, we will unlock value by having dedicated and well-skilled management teams. We will be able to provide our customers more innovative and tailored services and solutions to meet their evolving needs. Our employees will have the opportunities to work at more focused companies where they can gain more technical expertise and self-growth opportunities and have greater growth potential in their children's field. And the separation will benefit our community by providing more frequent solutions to solve social issues of carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience that we are all facing. We believe that there are three main benefits of the business separation. First, the standalone companies will have improved management and governance structures. Infrastructure service company and Device Company are expected to have dedicated management teams that bring deep industry knowledge with clear growth strategies. We will of course consider candidates from outside of the company for building new management structure. The new structures also will facilitate more agile decision making with greater focus and knowledge of their respective companies, customers and employees in addition new structure creates optionality for both new companies to make on separate and informed decision regarding potential strategic partners. Second, the standalone companies will have more effective, efficient and tailored capital allocation policies, more closely matching their industry peers. This will enable them to better explore options to optimize their cost of capital by managing their leverage and provide more direct engagement with the capital markets and increase the ability to target that inequity investors which could drive additional cost savings. And the third and certainly not least, we will be able to increase shareholders' return to Siva intense monetize shares and key auction while maximizing the shareholders' value and return the net The that doing so does not interfere with the smooth implementation of the separation. This will increase the return to Toshiba shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone companies. In addition, this will facilitate fair value by providing compelling investment opportunities that meet different preferences of the shareholders' investors. So, Shiba has recently beat up a strong track record of creating returns for In the last four years, we have steadily increased our dividend payment from 30 yen per share in FY 2018 to an expected 80 yen per share in FY21. In Gaddeshan, the special dividend of 110 yen per share had already been provided during FY 2021. Toshiba has also maintained a commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. We bought back 700 billion yen worth of the shares in 2019 and another 100 billion yen in 2021. Capital in excess of appropriate level of capital will be used to provide shareholders' return, including the share buyback in FY22, as well as in FY23, to the extent that it will not interfere with the smooth execution of our business and business separation. The expected amount is going to be about 100 billion yen. In addition, we will utilize appropriate level of levelages and continue reviewing of business portfolio including consideration of the divestiture opportunity. A strategic reorganization this time is the last step in Toshiba's commitment, latest step in Toshiba's commitment to creating and returning Shearhood's value. In this panel, we working with the relevant authorities and advisors to determine the best and the most effective and efficient way to spin-off the business with an intention of effective transaction in a tax-qualified spin-off structure pursuant to the recent tax reform legislation in Japan. We will continue to keep you updated as we move through this process. The timeline is that every organization is expected be completed in the second half of the fiscal year 2023, subject to a shareholders' food and in obtaining approval from the relevant authorities. However, we will make an effort to speed up the processes to the extent that is feasible. Moreover, we are considering seeking for shareholders to vote on it at the proposed extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders expected in the first quarter of the next calendar year, if possible. A board steering committee is expected to be formed, which will include strategic review committee members in order to provide continuity and accountability for the successful completion of the B operation. In terms of the costs associated with the spin-off, we expect to incur 10 billion yen from FY21 onwards. The spin-off costs are expected to be offset by reducing SDNAA expenses in each business's base on peer benchmarks. Now, over the past year, five months or so, we have proactively evaluated a full range of options to enhance shareholders' value. Following the strategic review committee's thorough evaluation, the board concluded that the strategic organization is the best path forward for Toshiba and its shareholders. Representing the Toshiba's management, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Braff and Chairperson of the Strategic Review Committee. On behalf of the board member, I would like to once again express the profound appreciation for your efforts and time spent through the evaluation of the wide-ranging Valley Enhancing Options over the years. Now I would like to call upon Mr. Braff to comment directly on this plan. the you all for attending. The Committee is confident the separation plan is the optimal path to value creation for all Toshiba shareholders. As Mr. Sunakawa outlined, the plan will create three independent entities, each of which will be better organised, equipped and focused to unlock shareholder value more effectively than the company can do in its current form. With greater focus and a strong foundation, each business will be better positioned to invest in future, consistent growth with this individual needs and capital allocation profile. This focus will generate more growth and innovation for customers, new opportunities for employees and potential to serve their communities and the world. In addition, shareholders will be able to benefit from the conversion of Toshiba's shares in Kiaoxia into cash, from which all net proceeds will be returned to shareholders. The significant net operating losses after SHIBA will be utilised to offset capital gains tax liabilities. This will increase returns for the SHIBA shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone businesses. This will also facilitate value creation by compelling investment opportunities that meet the different preferences of shareholders and investors. The separation plan represents a significant inflection point in our evolution, a bold new initiative that capitalises on the government's recent actions and looks beyond the confines of past Japanese business practices. The novel nature of this step for a company of Toshiba's importance is indicative of Toshiba's determination to follow the best course for long-term shareholder value creation. We undertook a rigorously objective process to arrive at this conclusion, including receiving input from a broad group of shareholders and both strategic and financial investors. We very much appreciate the views and perspectives that are reflected in the development of this plan. After comparing this plan to a wide range of other alternatives, we concluded that this approach provides shareholders the greatest potential for value enhancement with significant flexibility and opportunity for increased returns. This is by no means the end of the SRC's work. We shall continue to oversee the preparation of the separation plan until the shareholders vote on this at the proposed EGM in the first quarter of next year. At that point, it is expected that a board steering committee will be formed, which will include SRC members in order to provide continuity and accountability of a successful completion of the plan. Our collective backgrounds include highly relevant experience and expertise, and we expect to be supported in this effort by external expertise. We expect to be supported in this effort by external experts and newly recruited executives to help round out the existing management team. In conclusion, I would like to convey my personal conviction as Chairman of the SRC, that it is absolutely the right time to set forward for Toshiba and an exciting, energising and critical one that will launch the company on a compelling new value creation paths. We look forward to continuing our work and working closely with Mr Suna Kaur, the board and the management team as we implement the separation plan. And we look forward to hearing your reactions and responses and receiving your support at the forthcoming EGM. Thank you. Now, going back to the representation material, transforming Toshiba to enhance your whole value, I would like to call upon Mr. Hatazawa to explain the strategy. Good afternoon, I am Hatazawa. As Mr. Tanakawa just explained, Toshiba will spin off its two business operations to infrastructure service company and device company for evolution into the future. The next three years will be an important three years to ensure spin-off and to lay the groundwork for growth after spin-off and to transform ourselves for the future. I will explain on this important plan for the next three years. Please note that, figures shown under this section are based on the current organizational structure and only covered a period of three years from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023. We expect financial improvements will further accelerate once the separation is completed. We intended to announce a more refined management plan for each new company on a separate occasion at a later date. First, infrastructure services company will help our customers and partners achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. We are ideally positioned to address two important social issues, carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience and related needs of our customers. Infrastructure service company will utilize its customer knowledge and technological expertise to exploit such business opportunities in order to assist them in these areas. And we understand that the key to growth in energy and infrastructure lies in the intersection of AI, security and platform technologies. The conversion to cyber-physical solutions business is what we refer to as ex-digital. By working closely with our customers and partners, we will consolidate our domestic leadership in Japan and expand our global market share with focus in Asia. In the energy multiplied by digital domain, the realization of carbon neutrality is an urgent global issue for our customers. We already have a soundtrack record of delivering equipment and facilities to power utility suppliers as well as for EPC and maintenance services for power plants and in the transmission and distribution business. Further growth will result from the advancement of efficient use of energy through energy matting and energy management services. We will solve problems together with customers on both the power supply side and demand side. This is a huge market and we have new technologies to offer. Based on our vast experience working with partners, we will expand our business across the full value chain. Likewise, the infrastructure multiplied by digital domain offers us significant growth opportunities. We will create value for our customers by promoting optimal operation of infrastructure and achieve resilience by ensuring security. Already today, we have an established business model introducing equipment and facilities to infrastructure companies, including maintenance services. In the future, we will combine our operational knowledge and the digital technology specific to infrastructure users to provide asset management solutions including deterioration, diagnosis, O&M, automation and labor saving solutions and consulting to realize optimization of infrastructure operation costs and service usage costs. Our World Investment Plan for next three years underpinned our huge growth opportunities with about 500 billion yen, marked for CapEx R&D as well as M&A. We are eyeing to pursue a capital light business model for the infrastructure infrastructure service company with a medium to long term strategy. The infrastructure service company shows a solid financial profile and a strong growth outlook. The company expects net sales to grow at 3.3% compounded annual growth rate, CAGR, from $2.3.90 billion in fiscal year 2021 to 230 billion yen in fiscal year 2023. It also expects to improve operating income at 5% level much. And regarding free cash flow, we plan to improve free cash flow steadily and to maintain double digit ROIC at 10%. Device company. Device company will lead the evolution of social and information infrastructure through its semiconductor and storage businesses. Our leading products are significantly contributing to the wider society, including the realization of carbon neutrality. The strength of the business lies with its customer relationships, fears of experience with technology development, and capacity creation of production facilities, which we tend to expand with a sharper focus on its vast business cycle. We are well positioned as a global provider of leading products to transfer our technology further into profits and sustainable growth. In the field of power semiconductors, we will actively invest in the growth markets including the development of 300 millimeter line facilities and compound semiconductors, silicon carbide and gallium nitride. This will enable us to drive the acceleration of power efficiency, improvements in equipment and social infrastructure. We are targeting net sales of $120 billion in FY2023 compared with the $95 billion yen in FY21. Equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 13%. With expanding demand for data centers, along with the evolution of society's digitization, information infrastructure, significant market growth expected in storage business. Near line HCT through collaboration in the development of key components, advanced development in specialized areas and productivity improvement, rapidly expand the development of the high-capacity products and also strengthen support systems for data center customers. For Nearline HDDs, we have set a sales plan of 200 billion yen in FY21 and 280 billion in FY2023 equivalent to an annual growth rate of 18%. Prior to the separation, Device Company will invest to bolster its technological strengths in selected areas. In addition to expanding its Paris semiconductor production facilities, Device Company plans to increase the capacity of its semiconductor development facilities and the supply capacity of near line HDDs. In addition, its R&D focus will be on expanding its lineup and developing new models. We expect total investment of more than 300 billion yen in the three years till FY2023. For the device company as a whole, net sales at compound annual growth of 3.3% from $830 billion in FY21 to $880 billion to FY23. And excluding the growth for the transfer of memory, it is a 3.3% and operating income changes from 7.1% to 6.1%. However, if we take into consideration that the forex premise is 105 yen to the dollar in 22 and 23 and plan large investments during 2021 and 2022 for the growth beyond 2024, these needs to be considered and that the actual profitability is likely to improve. For the combined Toshiba group, in FY23, we are targeting net sales of 3.5 trillion, operating margin of 5.7%, REIC of 10%, pre-cash flow of 100 billion yen. As you can see from our remarks today, we are excited about the future. We look forward that through our spin-off plan the separation plan, that we will be able to deliver to all these stakeholders and that we will be transformative through this separation plan based on our management philosophy, are committed to people, committed to our future, we will continue to contribute broadly to society by creating a succession of new values and providing them to our customers. Thank you very much for listening. Next, we'd like to use the PowerPoint material titled F521 Second Quarter Consolidated Business Results. Mr. Hir, will be presenting on the results. Now, I Hirata will present on the second quarter results for FY 2021. Now, first, if you could turn to page 3, this is the key points of this result. Now, there are five key points. First point is regarding the fact that, for example, in the semiconductor business continuously from the first quarter, it is performed quite well in the second quarter and there is an improvement in energy business as well as a result during the first half of 2021. We were able to mark positive growth in revenue and income compared to the same period of last year. The sales revenue was $1,546.4 billion, with which a $175 billion increase of the revenue year over year. Now operating income was $45 billion,, which was 41.9 billion in increase compared to the same period last year. Now the second point is regarding free cash flow, which has improved due to the improvement of the EVDA and improvement in working capital due to the factors such as receipt of advanced payment. And here over here, we were able to see a great improvement. For the first half, that's positive 131.4 billion. That was an increase of 124.3 billion yen year over year. The third point is regarding order-taking. For orders which was increased very robustly due to a large scale project and it has increased by 19% year over year. Fourth point is regarding the forecast for the full year 2021. There are the surge in material and logistics costs as well as the shortage of a semiconductor product. And such impact is gradually visible. However, the semiconductor business of our company is performing well. It is offsetting the negative impact as a result of that operating income remains to be the same as the previous forecast at 170 billion yen. Next is the shareholders return policy. Now 100 billion yen of stock buyback as well as special dividend distribution of 110 yen was completed in the edition of the board organized today. We have approved of a 40 yen per share of the interim dividend. At the year-end dividend, the dividend forecast was already being announced at 40 yen per share, so the full year dividend forecast of 190 yen remains unchanged. If it could turn to slide six. This is the total picture of profit and loss statement. The first revenue for the first half was 1,546.4 billion yen and that was a 30% of increase in revenue. Now, the infrast systems had a slight decrease in revenue, however, for the other segments, all the segments, the five-infrast systems was increased its revenue. Operating income was 45 billion yen. There were the revenue increase on top of that. Weaker yen had positive impact at 41.9 billion yen increase year over year. The non-overading income and loss related to, for example, equity method companies such as Kyokxia, there's a positive of 37.1 billion yen. In total, income before income taxes was 82.1 billion yen, which is an increase of 62 billion yen. After that, income taxes were deducted and the net profit for this year is 59.8 billion yen, which was an increase of 56.3 billion yen year over year. Moving on to page 7, This is the operating income analysis compared to a year ago. Far left is the first half operating income of FY 2020, which was 3.1 billion yen. During the first half of FY 2020, the restructuring cost of 7.8 billion was posted, so we reversed back this amount and the operating income with that impact of restructuring cost was about 11 billion yen. And there are recovery from COVID pandemic and there are 40 billion yen of the revenue will be added and, presumably, the revenue is approximately 50 billion yen. And according to our business plan, in order to streamline the overseas offices and locations, we have posted about 5 billion yen worth of a restructuring cost, and therefore, as a result, operating income for the first half of FY21 was 45 billion yen. As is mentioned at the outset, there are more visible impact arising from bessoring material and logistics costs as well as semiconductor shortages. And as this boxes on top of the chart explained that a shortage of the semiconductor products is affecting as a reduction of the revenue as a result the revenue negative impact was about 6 billion yen. On that hand, the soaring material and logistics cost is considered as a part of the cost increase as a result. The cost increase was about 14 billion yen. At a total, there was the income reduction impact of 20 billion yen also. On page 8, non-operating income, as I said earlier, the equity in earnings of affiliate improved because mainly due to the yield set increase of profit by 16.8 billion yen. Therefore, for the first half in fiscal year 2021, that 37.1 billion was recorded up 20.1 billion yen from my ear earlier. Page 9, free cash flow positive 131.4 billion yen as I said at the outset and there was a cash out of the negative 53.1 billion yen cash flow from investing activities however due to that collection on AR at the end of a previous fiscal year in the receipt of the advances of large projects that cash flow from operating activities with positive 184.5 billion yen. And the bottom half provides the equity, attributable shareholders of the company, which decreased by 81.7 billion yen. The share, due to the share repurchase of 100 billion yen, an ear-end special dividend payout of 81.7 billion yen, and 1 trillion and the 45.2 billion yen was recorded. And the shareholder equity ratio was 30.5% and page 10 is the breakdown of what we have already explained and the shareholders equity ratio the net interest of bearing debt was 47.5 billion yen. And page 11, explanation by segment and page 12 is also by segment. As I explained earlier, excluding infrastructure system most increased in both sales and profit. And here is the energy system on page 13. Net sales was 236 billion yen, operating income was 4.5 billion yen. Net sales increased by 45.9 billion yen from a year earlier, as you can see here. The net sales increase in both power generation system transmission and distribution. Given this increase in net sales, operating income also improved by 12 billion yen from the previous year. Page 14. The top half provides infrastructure systems and solutions. Net sales were 272.1 billion yen, operating income was 0.3 billion yen. Public infrastructure, sales increased however in industrial systems with impact of pandemic still remaining and the net sales in the entire segment decreased by 9.9 billion yen and operating income as well on top of the decrease because of the decrease in net sales and cost of restructuring industrial systems. And recently there was an increase in cost in overseas projects in railways, therefore segment as a whole, so the decrease in operating income by 6.2 billion yen for the first half. The bottom half provides the results for building the solution. Net sales were 285.8 billion yen and operating income of 10.2 billion yen. Net sales recovered mainly in the air conditioning business and therefore net sales increased by 26.5 billion yen. And on the other hand, operating income due to the increase in net sales. And although there were negative impacts of the material cost increase and a logistic cost increase, and its impact of shortage of semiconductors, elevator escalator, business in particular, and also impacts of the forex and the ordino operating income was almost a flat. On page 15, device and storage net sales were 432.9 billion yen, which was up 108.9 billion yen from a year earlier. operating income was 34.7 billion yen, which is up 30.1 billion yen year on year. Semi-conductors and hard disk drive net increase, net sales increase mainly due to the recovery from the impact of pandemic and driven by the increase in sales and the impact of the forex and also effects of the restructuring which was conducted last year, income increased and in others and had a risk. In the same period last year, the operation ratio of the plant in the Philippines was reduced, the significant due to, mainly due to pandemic. Therefore, there was an increase of sales to data centers during this fiscal year. The gross ratio has been significant. Site 16. The upper half is retail and printing solutions. It sells 221.7 billion and operating income 4.3 billion. So it is in black compared to last making last year. Similarly, recovery from the COVID and also last year we conducted the restructure reform with this retail and both printing has achieved an increase in sales and also income. The bottom half is digital solutions. Mainly by the increase of the Page 17, amount of orders received and also the order backlog for the three years the trend is given on the left is the amount of orders received. For the first half the orders received compared ear on ear 19%, mainly in the energy system similar to FY19. In FY21 as well, there were orders of large scale projects. And if you move to the right part, which is the order backlog, order backlog also is steadily increasing. Then, please take a look at page 19. It is the equity earnings from Kyoksea. And for the figures I already mentioned earlier, if you take a look at the right part, BitGross and also ASP difference change is given in the bold font is that for the BID growth higher 10% range we are seeing quite a growth and for ASP, mid-single digit increase. Compared to three months before, first quarter, the price increase is becoming more slower. Page 20 explains about how we completed our share-repurchase plan. Site 21 and beyond is about the full-ear forecast for FY21 full-ear. For net sales, $3,350 billion yen. And compared to what we announced three months before, it is an upward revision of $100 billion. For income before tax and net income as Kyuxia's portion is unknown for the six months ahead. So this is just as of reference. In the first half, there was a 200, excuse me, 20 billion upward revision from Kyokxia equity earnings. So we have made an upward revision for the income before tax and also net income. For operating income and free cash flow, we maintain the previous forecast and there is no change. Site 23 is a forecast by segment. At the very right column, it gives the difference between the previous forecast and ounce three months before. A little lower than the middle divides and storage. For the revenue, 80 billion upward revision for net sales. However, having said that, out of this 80 billion, Kyokia memory resale is still included, which accounts for about half. So in real terms, semiconductor or hard-ride related gross increase in revenue is about 40 billion. And one column above retail and printing solutions, As Toshibatak already announced their figures and their overseas retail is very strong also with the Wieger Gänd we have made an upward vision of 20 billion. As they made this upward vision, we also reflected the same. And as I mentioned, for the company wide, operating income, no change, but by segment building solutions, especially retail printing, toshiba tech, because of the soaring material and logistic costs, lack of semiconductors, each segment compared to the previous announcement made a downward revision by 5 billion. On the other hand, in the first half, device and storage has been very strong, so in net it is a 15 billion increase in profit. Slide 24. Similar to first half analysis on the left is FY20, 104.4 billion operating profit and we had 17.5 billion restructuring cost. So this is reversed. It will mean that we have an operating profit income of 120 billion. In addition to this, if you go a little to the right on a planned basis we have the restructuring and 21 billion. Also, excuse me, restructuring cost of 10 billion and also fixed costs increased for 21 billion, half of that, at depreciation and also half is for R&D. With these expenses cost increasing, but with the increased in revenue and also with the effect of the restructuring, which will offset the increase of a cost and 170 billion profit is achievable. Lack of semiconductor and also the soaring material price, as I mentioned earlier, that is illustrated in the balloon. So that was about the second quarter results explanation. Thank you very much. That concludes the presentation part of the session. Now we'd like to move on to the Q&A session. And the question will be taken by Mr. Chirakawa, Mr. Atazawa, Mr. Hirataa, as well as the four members joining via online. And when there are questions, please state your name. Now, we will have 30 minutes questions to be picked up from the members of the field media. and let me label it on the message of taking questions. The questions are only be collected from the people who were registered beforehand and if you have any questions please press Asterix and 1. It is not a pound, but it is the Asterix.

Now we'd like to enter the conventions from Mr. Yao of Niepon Niekei. The Seheyo of Niekei. can you hear us? Thank you very much for the presentation. First off, regarding the separation into three entities, what are the flows of discussion that resulted in this conclusion? Well, between the Saba is a question of the Now, this is Sunakaba. May I answer to your question. Now, as is mentioned earlier, executive side and also the board meeting have had the meetings almost every week for the last five months. There were many strategic options that we discussed and also that were reviews of the medium term plan that we have compiled. And also we at the SRC had had a discussion about the potential privatization with partners, so we have compared many options. Now, we came in regard to the ideas of tax-free spin-off while we were discussing discussing and after the end of the discussion between SRC and the board we came up with this idea. And as PowerPoint had mentioned the executive CM management side had a very confident in pursuing this option of the tax-free spin-off. I believe that this is the best possible path forward for Toshiba. That is all. Thank you very much. Are there any other options that we have discussed? Could you elaborate on that? Could you repeat the question? So when the spinoff idea surfaced and SRC or the CMS meant who was the first one to say? And were there any other options regarding other options? Well, SRC will issue a report at a later date about how the discussion has developed. It was about 10 pages long, a document that we intend to publish in due course, but it was several months ago that this particular idea surfaced. And SRC, we at the management and advisors, all parties involved and made a discussion. In the course of the whole discussion, we came up with the idea of tax-free spin-off and the feasibility of that idea was recognized as a viable option and ultimately we came up with the idea of a separation into the Now regarding the future growth, now spinoff is just talking about the institution. It is means, but how are you going to make growth in real-term basis that I'd like to explore with you? Reason is that in regard to the Tushma Next Plan in FY25, $4 trillion of the net sales and $400 billion of operating income and 10% of operating income margin, that was a target. And a total of the three entities, you'll be able to exceed that initial target. And in the case of the changeable, the source of growth is coming from the technology developed by R&D. And what is the source of the development and how you're going to separate that into three entities? Could you enable it on that? I think the answer is that the question is to talk about the growth potential. And as page 8 describes, there are three rectangles. And from left and right, real-to-use speaking, that these are considered shareholders where we are changing the entity entity structures and simplify the operation so that we can materialize the value and thereby providing more options for the shareholders. But in regard to the growth of the square in the middle, where the forecast and agile management, that will be the largest difference vis-à-vis other ideas. To give you some specific ideas, and for example, as Misha Hatazawa mentioned earlier, the power semiconductor to be grown and then the investment into 300 millimeters was made. And that is something that I reflect upon now that semicher is in shortages nowadays and in retrospect probably a year before our decision or at least six months before our actual decision that the investment had had to be made but there were headquarters and the substrates and there are the topics, the intermediates and others. And therefore, it took quite a long time to make final decisions. And in terms of agility, there are something that we have personally flipped upon. And therefore, looking at each market, the competition situation and the peers that are competitive landscape that we need to carefully look at and the focus and the very small management will have to make very agile decisions so that we can compete well in the global market. So that's why we decided to separate the entities in this way. I personally believe that so. And in regard to a next question, how the number will play out? In regard to the specific targeted numbers when we discussed with Sheahorus as SRC has mentioned earlier that Toshiba always make the three-year medium-term plan in the year three, so we had never had achieved the results and the target. And that was actually a criticism that we have to face up. And we are thinking about the feasible number, and we incorporate that into this presentation. I just wanted to add that to my comment. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. As explained by Mr. Nakawa earlier regarding the statement by the Board. It has been already released on our press release webpage titled, The Processes Reading to the spin of plan by the board of directors of the company and that is already released on our website. Bloomberg, Mr. Furukawa, this is Furukawa of Bloomberg speaking. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. I have two questions. May I ask two questions at once? Yes, please. I have questions to Sena Kawasan regarding this reorganization. I understood advantage is very well, but changing the organization of the company. There will be risks incurred and potential demerits as well. In reorganization process, I think that you are going to explain this to employees and other stakeholders like business partners. Do you think that the all stakeholders will understand this and accept this? the shares will be partly purchased and most of the net proceeds will be returned to the shareholders. And this time are you going to divest all the shares held by the company and could you please explain whether the plan stays unchanged and an IPO policy related to Kyokxia, and do you still keep the strategy or policy to keep the Kyokxia IPO? And regarding merits and demerits and in the competitive landscape there are advantages regarding the creative capabilities of Toshiba. As in the question asked by the reporter from Nikkei, I couldn't respond to that regarding the research laboratories. Were there any concerns about that? He asked that question as well. And researchers and staffers in principle'm going to be divided into two companies, standalone companies. There needs to be a system of process allowing the exhibition of capabilities and we would like to work out the details related to the basic research at the research laboratories and that is the remaining challenge for us. We have to work on that but in principle, staffers will be divided into two standalone companies to promote individual companies. Semi-conductor energy and infrastructure, the core weight of the management strategy will be changed. But we believe that the disadvantage will outweigh disadvantages. And as you said, we would like to come up with a system to improve the situation related to any potential disadvantages in your question. Regarding your second question about Kyokse, whatever which will exceed the appropriate level of capital will be returned to shareholders. And earlier, a majority of stake, the net seats proceeds from the sale of the Kyok's shares will be returned to shareholders and considering the current financial position. Everything in excess of the appropriate capital, well, we thought that even if when we return all the proceeds from the sale to shareholders, we would be able to sustain the financial structure. So this time we said that all the proceeds will be returned to shareholders. Of course anything related to the spinoff will be kept. The IPOs policy which they unchanged. This is to be determined by Bing. Therefore, this is not something we are able to determine. But following the decision by Bing, we like to be cooperative with them so that we can be prepared. Thank you. Next NHK, Schmeissmann, please. This is Schmeiss from NHK. Do you hear me okay? Yes. I would like to ask Snagara-san. It is about disadvantage of the separation plant and there was a mention about the R&D. It's a three trillion yen cell size by splitting that, separating that. So size-wise, it will be smaller, first of all. So, but still, do you believe that you will be viable with the smaller size? And also, I would like to ask, Mr. Broff is that privatization has been often mentioned and this time, so the three entities being listed. So that is quite the contrary with privatization. So have you given up with the privatization and if you have given up with the privatization, so what was the reason in the cause? So can I hear from him? So first Mr. Srinakawa will respond and then we will be switching the image camera and also the voice to connect to Mr. Brof. So the question was about threegen being split and separated if whether we are concerned about that. For energy, infrastructure business, 2 trillion worth of business in size and semiconductor device, 4- device storage 1 trillion, a little less than 1 trillion. So this is sizable quite sized and we are aiming for a fresh start. And so we are willing to start a very fresh start for the financial position so we do not have any concerns. On the other hand, the two entities will be able to have a very agile management in their business and a very focused manner that is in a large advantage. So I think I will switch to Mr. Brof, switching the image and also the voice. Thank you Chairman. As Chairman Sunakawa has mentioned we have uploaded this afternoon the SRC's 10 page letter, which I think is probably unprecedented, explaining the journey that the SRC as well as the board has been through for the last five months. And within that letter, you will see a section related to the potential privatization of Toshiba and all of the work that we did on that particular option. But what we ultimately decided was that the plan that we presented today, the separation plan offered more flexibility to our shareholders and was in fact better as far as a long term growth and value of the sheba corporations concerned. So we believe the plan is the best for our shareholders. When we began the SRC exercise, there was a view expressed by some shareholders, but not all that we should be going straight to an auction process. But frankly, our fiduciary duties require us to explore all options and through that process the separation plan was developed. The reason for the separation plan is actually explained in the letter and it arose from with the strategic partners in a very deep manner for a stage, second stage, third stage, and many layers. There was discussion and each partner, example regulatory risk also about the antitrust also Kyokzvya that the price is difficult and unclear and we did not come to a very clear cut pricing. And that is also mentioned in the report. So I hope that you will read to the report. That is all for myself. So did you say that with the partners you already had discussion with about the general shareholder meeting? Do we are confident in what we have announced and explained and we are asking for the endorsement and to seek opinions from these shareholders we are expecting to hold EGM during January March. Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity. May I ask a question to Mr. Tuna Pava, separation into three entities. When we look at it from a different point of view, General comprehensive electric company, that idea has already been given up on and then this is a despondent of the company. What do you think of this opinion? Well, let me answer that being a comprehensive electric trucking company, be it a TV, a personal computer, and home appliances and medical that I used to belong to. There's nothing of the business already. And therefore, we are no longer comprehensive electronic player. However, social infrastructure and device business in semiconductors, these two entities, you mentioned that this is the disbandment, but in my opinion, this is the evolution for the future. So it is not the dismodlement, but it is the evolution for the future. So we would like to be very confident in moving forward to the future. May I ask a second question if I may? Now, the reorganization plan this time, what is the impact of the employment as well as the closure of your operating sites. Well, impact on the employment, I would not expect so, but that also requires a further explanation to the society at large. So that's the policy that we'd like to take going forward in regard to the closure of the operating sites. The plan does not complete with the announcement of the plan. Announcement of the plan is the starting point for the future evolution. This is the starting point for further development. And therefore, we will continue with the portfolio review, Kefto allocation policies. And we are poised to do that going forward. And on top of that, it's necessary. There's nothing be decided at this point in time, but we may conclude that perhaps the closure of the site is more rational, but we have started our path toward evolution. And therefore, in the Minister of our course of actions, there will be other opportunities as well. Last question, if I may. The governance enhancement committee report that I'd like to ask about in In that report, the former senior executive officers have engaged in acts in violation of the corporate ethics. And based on that, although the duty was already released from the former executives and still you are asking for them to pay back their renumerization and also the some damages are loaded to be made and what do you think of that? Well, first, the reason of the report was compiled that perhaps induced by the independent investigative report that perhaps the AGM wasn't organized in a fair manner, such as interfering with the voting activities of the shareholders and so forth. And then we, as a company, committed to the receipt of the independent investigative report in the very shares in CCI-Amana. It is not the legal decision whether that was acceptable or not. It is just the fact that we received the report from investigators and also some of the board's traits were rejected by the Shearihuruz and we believe that the pressure issue was the covenants issue of this company. That is awareness. So it wasn't about what had happened in the past. It was about the evolutions for the future. And without having the redevelopment of the governance structure of this company, the supply and supply will not be executed quite well. And therefore, as soon as possible, we would like to reorganize or redevelop the governance structure of this company. The full report of the governance enhancement committee was now published and I look at the fourth quarter regarding theatter regarding the recurrence prevention measures. And there were four major points was raised and how we are going to rebuild the governance of this company. How are we going to rebuild the governance? I'd like to highlight in my activities going forward in the company, I do not intend to just reflect upon what had happened in the past. We just make very sincere reflection about this. And it always, the case that the company would say that we thought something bad had happened and we will change going forward. That's not what we are going to do. We will do a serious exercise of such as brainstorming and discussions and we would like to be very strenuous of implementing the Recurrence Permission of Materials and I would like to spend a lot of time for that. Are you suggesting that what had happened has a bygone? So bygone speed bygone and you are going to focus on more forward-looking actions going forward. Is that a case? Well, compensation committee as Ms. Waddahiki mentioned, perhaps a compensation committee may discuss something about what had happened in the past, but personally, I've actually just count on the presidential committee for the decisions to come in the future. Kaudot. I have question to Mr. Tsubnakala regarding this decision. In the process leading to this decision, the completion of the board has been reduced from 13 by 5 members. And, Tana Khalsan, you are serving as the president as well, and on the board as well. So, I wonder how this decision was reached. So could you please give us your take on this? Yes, Chairperson of the Board is served as a temporary position and also for the President position. We needed to find a successor as soon as possible. Of course, the successor plan is being formed by any company. So anyway, this is something that should be determined by the nomination committee. So I will follow the decision by the committee. But for the current position and duties and responsibility, I would like to dedicate myself to fulfill these duties. So do you have the idea that you are going to continue to serve in order to accomplish this spin-off. Well, at the board, the current board serving, well, I think that by when I'm going to serve on the board, this is to be determined by the nomination committee's soul. But as far as we have this plan for the spinoff, and I would like to continue to dedicate myself. And Mr. Krumatami resigned. And he was engaged in saying that he will respect the engagement with shareholders. And I think that if there was no influence by the activists, do you think that you didn't? You had been reaching this decision this time around. Well, when you say activists, and in this process, we could learn a lot from the engagement with shareholders, particularly in relation to governance. There are many things that we could learn. Irrespective of whether or not shareholders are active or not, but this time in order to enhance the value of the company and to enhance the shareholders' value, we believe that this was the right decision three years ago in 2018. Toshiba Nextplan was formulated and at that time, the company's goal was to, through maximization of corporate value, TSL, total shareholder return is to be enhanced. This is what we said. So TSR or shareholder value to be maximized. That is what we said. And this policy has not changed at all. And this time, for the purpose of increasing the shareholder value or expanding the CSR, and this separation plan is very reasonable towards the future. We needed to make evolution. We believe that this is a very important one step towards that. Thank you very much. From Diane Monde, symbol Nissan, please. From Diane Monde, Simbogisan, please. From Jaya Monde, my name is Simbogie speaking. On a related note, I would like to ask, is it about the top management positions and I do have several questions. Within the ear to find a successor and also the chair of the board meeting and I understand that it will be difficult to find a successor within the calendar year. I would like to know whether that is correct and also what the reason. And perhaps Mr. Braff from the nomination committee or anyone who is suitable to answer. I hope that would be answered. And also my next question is about the separation plan into three entities about the President, CEO and the would that impact the finding the successor of the chairman and also when do you want to decide on the new management? So at the first question, we would like to ask Mr. Bofta and please wait as we will be switching the image and also the line. With regard to the separation plan, we should be able to recruit and retain people with more specialist skills rather than the generalist skills that are needed to run a conglomerate. And once we have the support of our shareholders, we will be on a course to start recruiting people for our respective boards. But that's a little bit early in the day at the moment. But of course the intention is to have appropriately qualified boards with industry experience to to run those two spindle businesses. I think beyond that we are going to go to our shareholders for an EDM in March. I think once we've got that endorsement we should be putting forward some more candidates for Toshiba Corporation 6502 to assist the board in particular with regard to the audit committee. Thank you. Excuse me, the EGN should be much and the translator mistakenly announced that it was May. About the outside board, directors deciding by December that plan and there was a question on that point and the reason. So this time, there's much strategic options and we had this change in course and within the process unless it was fixed and as we were not able to recruit and appoint someone so that was what was mentioned at the nomination committee. I am not a member of the nomination committee. So the first priority was placed on to creating and specify the separation plan that was the priority. That was the supplementary explanation. So, in that example, we will move to the next question. Next, take a look at the view of Kisei, please. Can you hear me? Yes, very well. This is Takaji of To You, Kisei. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would like to follow up the previous question. May I ask once again and confirm. Now, the chairperson of the company, for your company, what is the selection process? Well, the question is that, is itan Sun, are you going to serve as an intermature present to you until the spirit separation of the companies? May I confer once again? And I'd like to ask another question at this juncture that the company will be separated into three entities. And the third one, which is considered to be the current Toshiba portion, that the Kyokshia's Aztecs will be owned and also Toshiba Tech shareholder is going to be Toshiba. But do you think that Toshiba will disappear in the future? I just wondered the chairperson and CEO in the future regarding that outside the lecturers are comprising the nomination committee so it is up to the nomination committee's decision so at this point in time there's nothing that we know of and therefore it is up to the nomination committees to discuss going forward. Now regarding what would happen that the legacy Toshiba, what would happen on that entity, will the Toshiba, will earn the ownership stake of Kyokxia and for Kyokxia's ownership, we would like to monetize into the cash as soon as possible. And for Toshiba Tech, positioning is completely different. Well, Kyoksha is a pretty method applicable company and the Toshiba Tech is fully consolidated, listed as a subsidiary. What we call data business, for, there's nothing decided at this point. We are working on digitalization at the data business and Toshiba Tech learns many data and Toshiba Tech Business is indispensable for Toshiba overall. So what would happen for that entity? Currently there are the heavy data and also brand management issue as well. We need to discuss about the details going forward. So that is the current situation. Thank you. Now, do you have clear pathways for the investors and so forth? No, none. Are you asking about tech? Correct. The tech for the Tochua Tech, nothing is decided. May I ask a further question. Relationship of the three entities. Once these are spin off and it will be different independent entities. I'm not sure if legally a level or not. However, for example, cross-holding about shares, for example, among the three entities, would that be a viable option under the laws in regularization Japan, cross-shareholding of three entities as impossible? So we will not have a cross-sharing of the shares. Thank you very much. Next TV Tokyo, Abesam, please. This is Abbe of TV Tokyo. Can you hear me? Yes. In this press conference that materials are titled the transforming toshi bat to enhance shareholder value. And it used to be to enhance corporate value, but it has been changed to enhance shareholder value. Is it correct? Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure. The shareholder value should be enhanced. That was the word we finalized and by maximizing corporate value and then shareholder value will be also enhanced. So, in the end, ultimately shareholder value will be enhanced. As the means to do that, and then corporate value should be increased, so TSR should be expanded. So, as the final point to reach, we wrote the shareholder value. The reason why I asked this question, according to what I heard from the company's people and the current management team, maybe people are looking only towards the shareholders within the management team, and that is the criticism that we have heard from the people in the company, activists, so particularly in particular shareholders are considered most, and in preparation of this material. So, Naka-wasa, you mentioned that there are a lot of discussions, management team and the topic sectors of the subsidiaries and so forth. So, have you, I believe that there was only limited discussion with the top executives of the subsidiaries or operating companies and it was out of the blue for them. Do you think that you have obtained understanding from the internal people about this plan. We have been continuing to say, since three years ago when Toshiba next to plan was announced, that TSL should be enhanced. We have been keeping to say the same thing, but of course, shareholders, stakeholders, stakeholders, but of course, the society at large and employees, all the stakeholders should be valued. And this is our policy, which has stayed unchanged. and this time again, we do not change this policy at all by having this separation into three companies and then we believe that we will be able to provide appropriate services to customers and there will be incentives and various benefits and merits for employees as well, based upon the business cycle of each company after separation. And as an overall, for all the stakeholders, we believe that this decision is going to be the best option. Current shareholders will obtain the shares of the two standalone companies which will be listed on the market. Regarding the percentage, the mix or percentage of the shares to be allocated, do you think that this will be reflecting the current values? Well, I think that will be determined when the spinoff is completed. We do not have anything that has been clarified. Well, nothing clarified. Then the structure of the shareholding ownership structure is different. But I think there will be an option for shareholders to choose. Based upon the same ratio, I think maybe I should defer this question to CHE4. So in two years, sometime in two years from today, the ownership structure will be divided, I mean shares of the Toshiba held by Sherwooders will be divided and Sherwooders will be provided with the different shares in each company, each entity. So it will depend on the decision of shareholders regarding what to do with those allocated shares. And I think there is uncertainty whether or not the company will be able to maintain R&D functions. For example, in the case of infrastructure company, infrastructure business and the QKD business of course quantum encryption it will cost a lot of money in R&D activities. So after separating into two entities and research laboratories will be also divided into two. So do you think that you can be able to maintain such capabilities that Toshiba cutting edge technology can be really maintained? I think there needs to be more clearer forecast or outlook regarding this. Okay, I'd like to defer to Hata Zavasan. Within the numbers represented, CAPEX, R&D expenditures are explained for the coming three years. And according to the current plan, the gross plan to be supported by the gross funds as you know to be spent in the R&D and the CapEx. So these are estimated to be more aggressively spent R&D expenditures. In addition to the ratio of R&D expenditure in the total sales, which has been increased by 1% or 2% point, so overall we are going to put more focus on the R&D. And in terms of division into device and infrastructure and content of the research, it will depend on the wear in the business areas such activities can be allocated to and then the expenditures or efforts will be divided. As Tuna Ka-san mentioned and basic research, we would like to avoid the negative impacts of the spin-off. We will consider that in the process of spin-off completion. And R&D is continues to be important for the company. So we will continue to be even more aggressively in spending in the R&D. Lastly, have you already reported this plan to Metis? If so, what was the feedback? What was the reaction from Metis? Yes, we went to explain this to them in advance. I don't think there was any negative feedback from them. Thank you very much. So it is about time, so we would like to take the last question, Nikke business, please. This is called a different Nikke business. Do you hear me okay? Thank you. So I have three last questions, two to Snakasan. So by the Kyokse shares. So in order to solve the excessive net operating loss, I believe that it was being used. So we have the device company. So I don't think you need to be desperate to sell the shares. And if you keep the shares in stake, perhaps you can see some energy. But are you still willing to determine to sell the stake? And the second one is about the separation plan. So I think this special resolution will be required at the EGM, but I think that the special resolution to be attained is going to be very hard, high hurdle. And also, I believe that the split, the opinion is quite split. Is that is what I heard? Within the SRC, so why not sell to the PE fund but this separation plan was supported? So could you reiterate the reason because I did not find and the explanation the reasoning? So could I be answered? So myself, Tanaka, about these Kyokseya steak shares. So why not seek synergy with the semiconductor business? Memory business will require massive investment and even with the current financial position we have decided no longer to continue and so instead to monetize the stake so that has been already decided from the before and there is no change to this policy and about the two-third special resolution 2023 so until that point as I mentioned earlier this reform is just the beginning and it is sort of a declaration and so in the meantime there will be further reform that is coming to come and will be executed also capital policy as well and also for the shareholders that we will be endorsed and be supported we will make the effort. And Mr. Buff could you respond please? The SRC's letter to shareholders, which was published this afternoon, goes into some detail about the process we followed with regard to private equity. It was quite an exhaustive process going through several rounds with credible bias and at the end of the day the separation plan came about principally because of the difficulty in valuing the keyoxious shares at this time. And the separation plan was therefore regarded as superior to the private equity plan from a quantitative and qualitative aspect. So if you like, the separation plan emerged from our earlier discussions with regard to the management plan, with regard to possible minority investors, and with regard to private equity solutions. That's how it came about. Thank you. Did I answer your question? Now we'd like to close the sessions for the media. Next, we'd like to invite the social analyst and financial institutions to take up some questions. So those of you who were not picked up as a questionnaire, please be trapped your questions by pressing asterisk too. Now we'd like to open the sessions for the analyst and the investors and please enter your question by pressing asterisk and one. City Group, EZawa San, please. This is EZawa of City Group. Can you all hear me? Thank you very much. Two questions at this point. Until recently, now, they clearly identified the Norcore business or the divestitures of some part of the business or possibly to discuss that the company is themes and now the company has concluded that the spin-off is a option. But in terms of the divestitures compared to spin-off, well, compared to the divestitures versus spin-off, why did you conclude that spin-off generates the larger upslides in the company's shareholder value? And what is the benefit of having split? So could you elaborate on that specifically? That is the first question. Second question is, pertaining to the presentation by Tineawa Sun at the outset that business portfolio will opt for further revisions and portfolio re-adignment going forward. That's how I understood your presentation. Ultimately, the Intosiable group, what would be the desirable ways of how told about would be like in the future? I think it would be beyond what you have decided on in two years time, beyond that, as a result of the spin spin off. Do you think that a complete and separate industry entity would be ultimate form of the company or do you see further realignment of the company? Do you have any visions beyond two years time? Now question one and two, I think some parts are interlinked so at the beginning in the medium term plan, inclusive known core and core, it is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and known core. It is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and noncore. But we tried to focus on what the companies they would be in the near future. So that was the focal point this time. And therefore, the identifying versus non-core that is actually on the ongoing discussion at this moment as well and we will continue that discussion going forward as well. So what we have announced this time is just a starting point of improving the value going forward. So there will be two new codes and as soon as possible, they will prepare the business plan on their own and we'd like to provide opportunities so that two new goals will be able to present their own business plan for the future. Going back to the first question, what is the strengths and what was the advantage of the split idea versus the divestitures. There are three squares in the previous presentations and IMCEO of this company and therefore cash flow from the main business is the core challenge for me and that is the main theme in my opinion and for forecast and agile business management. It's the very important point in my view. Sorry, I'm talking too long, but in retrospect, I've been serving as CEO and COO for a very long time for this company. And what I remorse about is that we were able to, you were not able to exercise the gross strategy property. So at the right timing, we'd like to make an investment at the appropriate timing. We'd like to be very agile. And we have very good technologies at the highest or top in the world and we'll be able to use our marketing capabilities in a very quick and agile way. A question remains as is. So because of this split at this time, I hope that a single management who have specialized knowledge about this area will be able to make a very agile decision. I hope that this particular shortcoming of myself will be resolved in the separation of the businesses. So I try to answer two questions at once. It didn't satisfy yourself. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next. From SMBC Niko Securities, Yoshizumi Sangh. This is Yoshizumi of SMBC Niko Securities. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First question is through separation to unlock value. What is the concrete image of unlocking value through spinoffoff, congruent merit discount will be resolved. I think that was the basis. So are you sure that this congruent merit discount can be resolved? So could you please give us your specific opinion? In fiscal year 2021-23, the operating income of 200 billion yen, which is rather conservative and infrastructure service in Roik, is still 10%. I think earlier, in fresh products, in be secured. So I think that there will be the improvement room. But after this split and then 10% ROIC and then do you think that the congruent merit discount can be really cleared or resolved? So this is my first question about your expectation on these points. Okay, I would like to respond first and I would like to ask Hata Zavasan to supplement. And this time, unlocking the value. This is the headline, but the purpose itself is not to resolve the congruent merit discount. We need to clarify the structure so that each individual standalone company will be able to manage their business respectively and easy to understand manner as a result the performance will be better. So it will lead to that resolution of the Congromeretta discount. This is what I am feeling. Regarding numbers. I said earlier the numbers that can be achievable because we have been pointed out about the lack of achieving whatever commitment we have been making in the past. So there was the criticism from the sources on the market. So that's why we came up with these numbers which seem to be sure to be achieved. Hatazawa is going to supplement and in 2025 and towards 2030 we presented a plan towards those years and internally we have that forecast or targets for 2025. And based upon the opinion from external parties, we were asked to secure the delivery on the committed numbers. So that's why we came up with the conservative plan. And we are showing the plan for the coming three years alone. And in fiscal year 24, 25, we have a plan inside the company and we'd like to disclose those plans that appropriate opportunity and we talked about the importance of investing in R&D activities and the results will be realized in fiscal year 24 and 25. And external parties, particularly listening to the voices of shareholders and within the short period of time until fiscal year 23, what can be achieved and what can be achieved in the short term should be presented. So you may think that these numbers seem to be a little weak, but I'm sorry, that was the basis for coming up with this number. And we wanted to incorporate some risk buffers. So that's why we came up with this plan. That's all. Thank you. Thank you very much. My second question is for CFO. In the coming two years share buyback in the level of 100 billion yen you said and is it related to the sale of the shares in Kyokia or it is not included in the buyback plan and utilizing NOL and then what will be the advantage benefits of the tax issues at the time of a sale. So a qualitative comment will be okay. So could you please give us your comment? Thank you very much for your question. Regarding your first question, as Mr. Akhava mentioned, at our company, we have a yardistic of so-called appropriate level of capital. So, capital exceeding that appropriate level will be returned to shareholders. That's what we have been saying as Hatatavasam mentioned earlier in 2021, this current fiscal year and this coming 22. In these years, we came up with this rather sure plan. Therefore, we will be able to achieve this net income number. So considering all these, and according to our calculation, we will be able to return in the order of about 100 billion yen to shareholders. So regarding the gains from the sale of Kiaoksha shares is outside of this number and regarding the NOL, net operating loss, as you know, according to the tax law for the current fiscal year, half of the amount recorded in the fiscal year can be utilized. So based on the balance sheet that there is a NOL in the amount of about 300 billion yen. So how and when Kyokshia, Kyokshia stake in Kyokshia can be sold at any point. So if at that time if we still have the NOL and then about half of the gains obtained through the sale of Kia or Kia or Kia or Kia will be offset by the NOL. Thank you very much understood. Thank you. Next. UBS. Yes, please. Thank you. UBS. This is Yesi speaking. Yes, we hear you. I have one question, but there are three aims in asking my one question. So this announcement about how management is done, also how the business exists, I am sure that there was a lot of discussion on these matters. So the ideal state of Tushiba, what do you believe is the most ideal? I know that it could be something unrealistic, but could you explain about the ideal state of Toshiba? The reason I am asking, there are three reasons. What do you think the issue of Toshiba is? And the process, not how you reflected, but if there's anything in a event that has led you to the process and also second part is that when selecting the management of the new separated company, when you want to hand over to the new management, what is your ambition? What is your hope that the new management to realize? And also the three part is that the USGE also have decided the separation. So I believe that separation spinoff is now being questioned and this is something beyond shareholders. So what is the significance meaning of separation? I understand being agile, that is one of the advantage, but also this hasn't said from the early 2000s. And so why now today separation spin off is being decided does that reflect something in society so these are my questions I would like to respond and if any of the two of my colleagues have anything to add. So what is the ideal state? So I know that this will differ, but for myself, when we have a business and we are trying to solve the social issues around us and that is what is happening on a daily basis and the repetition. Personally, the company brand that is nothing that is not where I am particular about. Well, medical social medical some went to kind of medical and would give it a COVID situation. And MRI, for example, very well, and a well positioned in Japan globally, which is very... And although I'm sad that Oshiba name is gone, but what I have done is contribute to society and see it growing that itself makes me very happy. So, in the same sense, in the same notes, that what we are doing in our business that our employees being satisfied and also contributing to society, I think that is the ideal way, ideal state. So even in the form that it is split into two or more with the name changes, but our mission itself, how we execute and realize the mission, I think that is the important part. And so I was questioning myself, what is the ideal state? I know that I'm talking a lot, so perhaps this will be my response. And also, so asked what I expect towards a future management, especially the largest issue is governance. So when it comes to governance, this is going to be the fundamentals in management and governance has pointed out that although it may take some time that we want to reconstruct the governance and also with a new company management. There was a mention about what type is suitable and it is mentioned sometimes we will see someone from the outside of the market and also something with the capability of the governance perspective that is going to be some of the basics requirements qualifications. And it was just by chance that GE also announced that Nikkeit-Sleeq with that we were a little earlier in with our scheme to be known I don't know if this answers GSE sense question, but that is my impression. Do you have anything to add? There's also a response. I think that what each individual will be answering will be different. So this is my personal view. Myself, I believe that Toshiba's mission and philosophy is that what is asked for by Toshiba and we have the responsibility to execute our responsibility. So that is what we are required of and that is the reason of existence. So that is one thing. On the other hand, what clients, customers request us? Sometimes the time is different and also the requirement is different, meaning that sometimes we cannot make a management decision which has been pointed out as an issue, I think this applies to GE. The management environment has changed. Speed is required. So not luck at time in the past with a lot of things mixed in between. We will not be able to catch up and we cannot make a pure decision in order to survive. So that is why I believe that spinoff or separation could be one of the trend. We have the infrastructure, energy, and serve the clients in this industry and we believe that Toshiba may have only the answer and for the device and discs and also for the future information society. What is required of Sushiva? We need to create the solutions in a quickly manner that is requested by our clients. I think that is what we exist for and that is the reasoning for why we have decided on this decision and also it matches the needs. Also, let me also say a few words. From a financial position perspective, from a shareholder, we have the agreed and also we want to steadily increase the value. That is also the mission of the company. For this to happen, as Hadazasan mentioned, we need to win the trust of our client's customers and also we have to deliver the products and services that is required of. And what is most important is that the employees also share the same mission, look at the same direction, be aligned in the same mission. So eventually that will lead to increase the value for the shareholders and unlock the values. There are various means to realize this and given the current situation of Toshiba, what we have been discussing and what we are trying to execute, this framework is going to be the best path forward for the shareholders. I personally believe so. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next, we would like to invite from Goldman Sachs Mr. Harada please. This is Harada speaking from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. Can you all hear me? Thank you. Now, I would like to ask one question. Now, my question may sound very similar to the previous questions. Now, Infra services and device that you are going to separate into. And Infra services company itself is considered a congruent in my opinion when looked at the business structure. On the global basis, for example, elevators could be the vestigers going forward or carve it out going forward and going forward. Do you think that further realignment of military services in scope or in your vision at this point? And in addition, there are many congruent matters based companies in Japan. Be good or bad. your company is having a connection with Métis, then in order to enhance competitiveness of the overall corporate Japan, perhaps the real momentum of the company's evolving whole corporate society in Japan is perhaps considered. Was that a part of discussion with them? And also being a part of the concept of the Messiah, the same management. would that be also something that you would consider if good opportunity arises, are you conscious of this type of operation or opportunity? So if for a structured company, there are a variety of businesses included. However, there are some common denominators, for example, be it services and subscription models. And it is quite a high potential of sharing the commonality across the different businesses and infrastructure services. But like I mentioned earlier, portfolio review exercise will continue and there's nothing that we have decided at this point in time and yet we'd like to continue to discuss going forward. Now regarding regarding the realignment of the industries in Japan, my position is at least that we reviewed all possible opportunities and options exhaustively, Think about all the stakeholders such as shareholder employees and society, a large customer and we'd like to review from that point of view. That is my position. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your comment. That is all. Thank you very much. Now, we'd like to entertain one last question at this point in time. SBI, it's an isam, please. Thank you very much. I have two questions regarding spin-off to list span of companies on the market. I am not experienced in this area so could you please give us timeline for new calls including their balance sheets. The treatment of such accounting will be starting from the third quarter of this fiscal year 21 and then in two years from today, and a spinoff will be completed. This is my understanding, is this correct? And the second question is about the company names of the new codes. Do you plan to name with Toshiba in the company's name, like Kyokshia or other? I think that in this scheme, I think the new company's name would be like the ones as Kyokxias. Regarding the timeline for the companies to be listed on the market, there needs to be a two-fiscal year is financial results to be audited. So therefore our target is in the second half of 23. Fiscal year 23, here are the some will supplement and regarding the company names, there is nothing that has been determined yet. We are going to 5. a little bit. I think on page 12 there was this schedule for timeline. We would like to observe and follow this timeline as much as possible and with some better ideas or devising the ideas we like to shorten this duration. As you can see here, there is a necessity for two fiscal years financial numbers to be audited. This is the requirement by TSE and for this fiscal year in 2022 the numbers operation is based upon the assumption that the current organizational structure will continue. And of course there are lots to be worked out with auditors and for fiscal year 2021 the financial results to be closed based on the current Toshiba organization and then that will be the basis for the new goals and then we would divide the numbers into two companies. Some point in fiscal year 2022, we like to finalize the numbers for the new companies to be established in parallel for fiscal year 2022 based on the current consolidation under the Toshiba group and financial statements will be prepared and based upon the three new codes we are going to create three separate financial statements so that we will be working in language the current timeline and regarding the internal control examination to be conducted by auditors as well. So of course for Toshiba Corporation on the current consolidation basis, of course we would continue operation for fiscal year 2022. So in parallel with that, based upon the new organizational structure, which will be created so that internal control will be functioning. So we will check whether internal control will be working well in those certain new organization structures. So it will be going to be complicated during 2022. Until the end of fiscal year 2022, current organization structure will be maintained. But in parallel, we will prepare gradually the separate balance sheets for three new companies. Of course, there are a lot to be done, but roughly speaking, this is our current plan. Thank you. Thank you very much. So otherwise as it will be the last. But there was one question left from the media, so we would like to take the last question. Mr. Vashoyo, do you see, are you still connected? So we will close the questions. So there is one correction. Snokeau are missioned. Is that about these spin off related? Is that there was a leak from the Nikkei article. It is not a leak by the company, so I want to make a correction. So thank you very much for all the participants coming to the press release and also those participating for the phone, please make sure that you hang off.\"}"

              "{'text': \" Now, it's time. May I start the presentation on Transforming Toshi Bata Enhanced Heroes Value and FY21 Second Quarter Consulated Business Results. We are organizing this presentation on online basis. From 4 to 5 o'clock, we will be presenting from our side and followed by 30 minutes question session for the middle of the media. The questions from Alice and investors will be accepted from 5.30 to 6 o'clock Japan time. Please be aware of that. Now, we will be collecting questions via telephone conferencing system. As is informed to you beforehand, the conference call system will require the pre-registration beforehand. Let me introduce the presenter today. President NCEO, Satoshi Tsunakawa. Corporate Senior Executive Vice President, Mamoru Hatazawa. Representative Jesus Officer, Corporate Executive Vice President, N C F O, Masayoshi Hirata. We have a chairperson of the strategic review committee outside director, Paul Broth. He is joining from Hong Kong online. My name is Hara of Corporate Communication Department. We are providing simultaneous transition, so if you are watching the live streaming in Japanese, you will be able to hear translation's voice. Please be aware of that. First, before going into Transforming Toshiba to enhance your host value, may I have Mr. Tanaka to see a few words upon the receipt of the report from the governance enhancement committee today. Mr. Senakawa, please. Now, first of all, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the company upon the report of the Government and Assessment Committee. First off, I would like to express profound appreciation to the members of the Government and Medicine Committee who have made tremendous efforts and time since their appointment to investigate the root codes of issue and raised in the investigation report, collodify where the response was utilized and compile recommendations for formulating the major's revenge recurrence. I recognize that the Toshiba's Government Assessment Committee, based on the strong belief that restructuring of the governance is essential for the revival of the Toshiba, has compiled a report for our future. In fact, no issue of illegality was discovered according to the report of the Government Enhancement Committee. Having said that, I feel as a part of the senior management of the company, I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the senior members of the company. I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the senior members of the company and their actions was concluded that an act as a whole violates the corporate ethics demanded by the market. We have just received a final report of the governance enhanced committee, but we will continue to discuss the governance seriously within the company based on the contents of the report, including recommendations for the formulation of the recurrence prevention measures. We believe that this recurrence prevention measures will form the very first step to restore the trust of the shareholders which have been restored so far. Now, one of the group's philosophy is doing the right thing. Many employees on the front lines of operations are working day to day based on this value. On the other hand, I believe that some of the members of the Single Management were acted quite differently from this velocity and that should be sincerely remorzed over. The Corporate Management is established based on the trust relationship with all stakeholders, the Government and Assessment Committee also pointed out that the importance of top at the tone and organizational leaders demonstrating their commitment to value ethics and integrity. Until now, the culture to recognize the mistakes and the very good communication so that anyone can raise opinions escalated to the higher level, but also we need to ensure the psychological safety of all employees. We will make persistent efforts in this regard. As I will announce today, our group decided to separate the energy infrastructure, business and storage device businesses that, they will be separate companies and aim for the IPOs independently. This is a draft exchange, but because these businesses will be separated and being independent. And therefore, the committed to people and committed to the future based on this philosophy under the new corporate culture, each business is poised to grow and this is a great opportunity. But beforehand, it is a critical mission of the Singapore government to enhance governance beforehand. It is a critical mission of the senior management to enhance governance beforehand. I appreciate your continued support and asking for your cooperation. Thank you very much. Next, we'd like to present on the transforming Toshiba to enhance Ashihori's value and Mr. Tuna Kawa will make presentations. Next, I'd like to explain on our new management policy titled, Transforming Toshi Bato Enhanced Childers Value. The corporate executive vice president, Hata Zawa, will also be presenting and also online, chairperson of the strategic Review Committee, Mr. Paul, will also be attending as well. Now, today, Toshiba Group has decided on its significant transformation to further refort for the future. Let me first introduce why this is the best path forward for Toshiba and our shareholders and what it means for our business going forward. And then we would like to invite Mr. Braff to explain on the evaluation made by the Strategic Review Committee. After that, Mr. Hadada will talk on what the business outlook will be. The that I'd like to explain. Now, at the Board of Directors Meeting held this morning, the decision was made for Toshiba's strategic reorganization to separate the businesses into two businesses as a result. There will be three standalone companies to be formulated. One is Insta-sexual service company, second is Device Company, and the third is Toshiba. As we conclude this strategic reorganization to be the best path forward for Toshiba and their stakeholders, we took into account the view of our important stakeholders and other stakeholders, as well as the business characteristics and the value chain of each of our diverse businesses. Over our history of over 140 years, Toshiba has constantly evolved to stay ahead of the times. Today's announcement is no different. Toshiba has built a portfolio of leading businesses, but in order to enhance our competitive positioning, each business needs greater flexibility to address its own market opportunities and challenges. The official names for the new companies will be announced in due course. Here is an overview of the three independent businesses. Infrastructure Service Company will consist of Toshiba Energy Systems and Solutions, infrastructure systems and solutions, building solutions, digital solutions, and battery businesses, and become a company with the forecasted net sales of 2.1 trillion according to the fiscal year's forecast. Its increased focus combined with its innovative technological solutions will enable it to play a lean role in driving the transition to renewable energy to meet ambitious global carbon neutrality goals and advancing infrastructure resilience as a leading player. Device company will be comprised of the Toshiba electric device and storage solutions business and become accompanied with forecasted net sales of 870 billion yen. Its products will be including powers and conductors, high-capacity, hard disk drives, HDD for data centers, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It will be a global leader in supporting the evolution of social and IT infrastructure. Toshiba will continue to hold the companies on ownership stake in Kyokshia holding cooperation and Toshiba tech cooperation. Toshiba will seek to monetize the share of Kyokshia at an appropriate timing. The separation, this time, enables us to better align each new company by its unique business characteristics. Infantasture service company really did business focus on the direct sale of equipment and the provision of solutions to specific customers. It has long business cycles that are more heavily dependent on negotiations between business parties than the market conditions at large. In addition, it will be a capital-light business, and there are also major differences to the extent in which we conduct customized production. In contrast, device companies primarily manufactures and sells devices such as semiconductors and other materials, its business cycles are shorter and can be impacted significantly by the market conditions. It will be a capital intensive business that requires scale of continuous production across multiple customer orders and relatively speaking, the large capital investment needs to be made in a very flexible manner. So objective of a spin-off, there are three reasons. First, the separation will unlock immense value by removing complexity. Second, it enables us to have a much more focused and agile decision-making and their management. And the third separation naturally enhances choices for our shareholders. Our board and management team firmly believe that the strategic reorganization is the right step for sustainable profitable growth for each of the businesses and the best path to create additional value for our stakeholders. For our shareholders, we will unlock value by having dedicated and well-skilled management teams. We will be able to provide our customers more innovative and tailored services and solutions to meet their evolving needs. Our employees will have the opportunities to work at more focused companies where they can gain more technical expertise and self-growth opportunities and have greater growth potential in their children's field. And the separation will benefit our community by providing more frequent solutions to solve social issues of carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience that we are all facing. We believe that there are three main benefits of the business separation. First, the standalone companies will have improved management and governance structures. Infrastructure service company and Device Company are expected to have dedicated management teams that bring deep industry knowledge with clear growth strategies. We will of course consider candidates from outside of the company for building new management structure. The new structures also will facilitate more agile decision making with greater focus and knowledge of their respective companies, customers and employees in addition new structure creates optionality for both new companies to make on separate and informed decision regarding potential strategic partners. Second, the standalone companies will have more effective, efficient and tailored capital allocation policies, more closely matching their industry peers. This will enable them to better explore options to optimize their cost of capital by managing their leverage and provide more direct engagement with the capital markets and increase the ability to target that inequity investors which could drive additional cost savings. And the third and certainly not least, we will be able to increase shareholders' return to Siva intense monetize shares and key auction while maximizing the shareholders' value and return the net The that doing so does not interfere with the smooth implementation of the separation. This will increase the return to Toshiba shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone companies. In addition, this will facilitate fair value by providing compelling investment opportunities that meet different preferences of the shareholders' investors. So, Shiba has recently beat up a strong track record of creating returns for In the last four years, we have steadily increased our dividend payment from 30 yen per share in FY 2018 to an expected 80 yen per share in FY21. In Gaddeshan, the special dividend of 110 yen per share had already been provided during FY 2021. Toshiba has also maintained a commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. We bought back 700 billion yen worth of the shares in 2019 and another 100 billion yen in 2021. Capital in excess of appropriate level of capital will be used to provide shareholders' return, including the share buyback in FY22, as well as in FY23, to the extent that it will not interfere with the smooth execution of our business and business separation. The expected amount is going to be about 100 billion yen. In addition, we will utilize appropriate level of levelages and continue reviewing of business portfolio including consideration of the divestiture opportunity. A strategic reorganization this time is the last step in Toshiba's commitment, latest step in Toshiba's commitment to creating and returning Shearhood's value. In this panel, we working with the relevant authorities and advisors to determine the best and the most effective and efficient way to spin-off the business with an intention of effective transaction in a tax-qualified spin-off structure pursuant to the recent tax reform legislation in Japan. We will continue to keep you updated as we move through this process. The timeline is that every organization is expected be completed in the second half of the fiscal year 2023, subject to a shareholders' food and in obtaining approval from the relevant authorities. However, we will make an effort to speed up the processes to the extent that is feasible. Moreover, we are considering seeking for shareholders to vote on it at the proposed extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders expected in the first quarter of the next calendar year, if possible. A board steering committee is expected to be formed, which will include strategic review committee members in order to provide continuity and accountability for the successful completion of the B operation. In terms of the costs associated with the spin-off, we expect to incur 10 billion yen from FY21 onwards. The spin-off costs are expected to be offset by reducing SDNAA expenses in each business's base on peer benchmarks. Now, over the past year, five months or so, we have proactively evaluated a full range of options to enhance shareholders' value. Following the strategic review committee's thorough evaluation, the board concluded that the strategic organization is the best path forward for Toshiba and its shareholders. Representing the Toshiba's management, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Braff and Chairperson of the Strategic Review Committee. On behalf of the board member, I would like to once again express the profound appreciation for your efforts and time spent through the evaluation of the wide-ranging Valley Enhancing Options over the years. Now I would like to call upon Mr. Braff to comment directly on this plan. the you all for attending. The Committee is confident the separation plan is the optimal path to value creation for all Toshiba shareholders. As Mr. Sunakawa outlined, the plan will create three independent entities, each of which will be better organised, equipped and focused to unlock shareholder value more effectively than the company can do in its current form. With greater focus and a strong foundation, each business will be better positioned to invest in future, consistent growth with this individual needs and capital allocation profile. This focus will generate more growth and innovation for customers, new opportunities for employees and potential to serve their communities and the world. In addition, shareholders will be able to benefit from the conversion of Toshiba's shares in Kiaoxia into cash, from which all net proceeds will be returned to shareholders. The significant net operating losses after SHIBA will be utilised to offset capital gains tax liabilities. This will increase returns for the SHIBA shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone businesses. This will also facilitate value creation by compelling investment opportunities that meet the different preferences of shareholders and investors. The separation plan represents a significant inflection point in our evolution, a bold new initiative that capitalises on the government's recent actions and looks beyond the confines of past Japanese business practices. The novel nature of this step for a company of Toshiba's importance is indicative of Toshiba's determination to follow the best course for long-term shareholder value creation. We undertook a rigorously objective process to arrive at this conclusion, including receiving input from a broad group of shareholders and both strategic and financial investors. We very much appreciate the views and perspectives that are reflected in the development of this plan. After comparing this plan to a wide range of other alternatives, we concluded that this approach provides shareholders the greatest potential for value enhancement with significant flexibility and opportunity for increased returns. This is by no means the end of the SRC's work. We shall continue to oversee the preparation of the separation plan until the shareholders vote on this at the proposed EGM in the first quarter of next year. At that point, it is expected that a board steering committee will be formed, which will include SRC members in order to provide continuity and accountability of a successful completion of the plan. Our collective backgrounds include highly relevant experience and expertise, and we expect to be supported in this effort by external expertise. We expect to be supported in this effort by external experts and newly recruited executives to help round out the existing management team. In conclusion, I would like to convey my personal conviction as Chairman of the SRC, that it is absolutely the right time to set forward for Toshiba and an exciting, energising and critical one that will launch the company on a compelling new value creation paths. We look forward to continuing our work and working closely with Mr Suna Kaur, the board and the management team as we implement the separation plan. And we look forward to hearing your reactions and responses and receiving your support at the forthcoming EGM. Thank you. Now, going back to the representation material, transforming Toshiba to enhance your whole value, I would like to call upon Mr. Hatazawa to explain the strategy. Good afternoon, I am Hatazawa. As Mr. Tanakawa just explained, Toshiba will spin off its two business operations to infrastructure service company and device company for evolution into the future. The next three years will be an important three years to ensure spin-off and to lay the groundwork for growth after spin-off and to transform ourselves for the future. I will explain on this important plan for the next three years. Please note that, figures shown under this section are based on the current organizational structure and only covered a period of three years from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023. We expect financial improvements will further accelerate once the separation is completed. We intended to announce a more refined management plan for each new company on a separate occasion at a later date. First, infrastructure services company will help our customers and partners achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. We are ideally positioned to address two important social issues, carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience and related needs of our customers. Infrastructure service company will utilize its customer knowledge and technological expertise to exploit such business opportunities in order to assist them in these areas. And we understand that the key to growth in energy and infrastructure lies in the intersection of AI, security and platform technologies. The conversion to cyber-physical solutions business is what we refer to as ex-digital. By working closely with our customers and partners, we will consolidate our domestic leadership in Japan and expand our global market share with focus in Asia. In the energy multiplied by digital domain, the realization of carbon neutrality is an urgent global issue for our customers. We already have a soundtrack record of delivering equipment and facilities to power utility suppliers as well as for EPC and maintenance services for power plants and in the transmission and distribution business. Further growth will result from the advancement of efficient use of energy through energy matting and energy management services. We will solve problems together with customers on both the power supply side and demand side. This is a huge market and we have new technologies to offer. Based on our vast experience working with partners, we will expand our business across the full value chain. Likewise, the infrastructure multiplied by digital domain offers us significant growth opportunities. We will create value for our customers by promoting optimal operation of infrastructure and achieve resilience by ensuring security. Already today, we have an established business model introducing equipment and facilities to infrastructure companies, including maintenance services. In the future, we will combine our operational knowledge and the digital technology specific to infrastructure users to provide asset management solutions including deterioration, diagnosis, O&M, automation and labor saving solutions and consulting to realize optimization of infrastructure operation costs and service usage costs. Our World Investment Plan for next three years underpinned our huge growth opportunities with about 500 billion yen, marked for CapEx R&D as well as M&A. We are eyeing to pursue a capital light business model for the infrastructure infrastructure service company with a medium to long term strategy. The infrastructure service company shows a solid financial profile and a strong growth outlook. The company expects net sales to grow at 3.3% compounded annual growth rate, CAGR, from $2.3.90 billion in fiscal year 2021 to 230 billion yen in fiscal year 2023. It also expects to improve operating income at 5% level much. And regarding free cash flow, we plan to improve free cash flow steadily and to maintain double digit ROIC at 10%. Device company. Device company will lead the evolution of social and information infrastructure through its semiconductor and storage businesses. Our leading products are significantly contributing to the wider society, including the realization of carbon neutrality. The strength of the business lies with its customer relationships, fears of experience with technology development, and capacity creation of production facilities, which we tend to expand with a sharper focus on its vast business cycle. We are well positioned as a global provider of leading products to transfer our technology further into profits and sustainable growth. In the field of power semiconductors, we will actively invest in the growth markets including the development of 300 millimeter line facilities and compound semiconductors, silicon carbide and gallium nitride. This will enable us to drive the acceleration of power efficiency, improvements in equipment and social infrastructure. We are targeting net sales of $120 billion in FY2023 compared with the $95 billion yen in FY21. Equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 13%. With expanding demand for data centers, along with the evolution of society's digitization, information infrastructure, significant market growth expected in storage business. Near line HCT through collaboration in the development of key components, advanced development in specialized areas and productivity improvement, rapidly expand the development of the high-capacity products and also strengthen support systems for data center customers. For Nearline HDDs, we have set a sales plan of 200 billion yen in FY21 and 280 billion in FY2023 equivalent to an annual growth rate of 18%. Prior to the separation, Device Company will invest to bolster its technological strengths in selected areas. In addition to expanding its Paris semiconductor production facilities, Device Company plans to increase the capacity of its semiconductor development facilities and the supply capacity of near line HDDs. In addition, its R&D focus will be on expanding its lineup and developing new models. We expect total investment of more than 300 billion yen in the three years till FY2023. For the device company as a whole, net sales at compound annual growth of 3.3% from $830 billion in FY21 to $880 billion to FY23. And excluding the growth for the transfer of memory, it is a 3.3% and operating income changes from 7.1% to 6.1%. However, if we take into consideration that the forex premise is 105 yen to the dollar in 22 and 23 and plan large investments during 2021 and 2022 for the growth beyond 2024, these needs to be considered and that the actual profitability is likely to improve. For the combined Toshiba group, in FY23, we are targeting net sales of 3.5 trillion, operating margin of 5.7%, REIC of 10%, pre-cash flow of 100 billion yen. As you can see from our remarks today, we are excited about the future. We look forward that through our spin-off plan the separation plan, that we will be able to deliver to all these stakeholders and that we will be transformative through this separation plan based on our management philosophy, are committed to people, committed to our future, we will continue to contribute broadly to society by creating a succession of new values and providing them to our customers. Thank you very much for listening. Next, we'd like to use the PowerPoint material titled F521 Second Quarter Consolidated Business Results. Mr. Hir, will be presenting on the results. Now, I Hirata will present on the second quarter results for FY 2021. Now, first, if you could turn to page 3, this is the key points of this result. Now, there are five key points. First point is regarding the fact that, for example, in the semiconductor business continuously from the first quarter, it is performed quite well in the second quarter and there is an improvement in energy business as well as a result during the first half of 2021. We were able to mark positive growth in revenue and income compared to the same period of last year. The sales revenue was $1,546.4 billion, with which a $175 billion increase of the revenue year over year. Now operating income was $45 billion,, which was 41.9 billion in increase compared to the same period last year. Now the second point is regarding free cash flow, which has improved due to the improvement of the EVDA and improvement in working capital due to the factors such as receipt of advanced payment. And here over here, we were able to see a great improvement. For the first half, that's positive 131.4 billion. That was an increase of 124.3 billion yen year over year. The third point is regarding order-taking. For orders which was increased very robustly due to a large scale project and it has increased by 19% year over year. Fourth point is regarding the forecast for the full year 2021. There are the surge in material and logistics costs as well as the shortage of a semiconductor product. And such impact is gradually visible. However, the semiconductor business of our company is performing well. It is offsetting the negative impact as a result of that operating income remains to be the same as the previous forecast at 170 billion yen. Next is the shareholders return policy. Now 100 billion yen of stock buyback as well as special dividend distribution of 110 yen was completed in the edition of the board organized today. We have approved of a 40 yen per share of the interim dividend. At the year-end dividend, the dividend forecast was already being announced at 40 yen per share, so the full year dividend forecast of 190 yen remains unchanged. If it could turn to slide six. This is the total picture of profit and loss statement. The first revenue for the first half was 1,546.4 billion yen and that was a 30% of increase in revenue. Now, the infrast systems had a slight decrease in revenue, however, for the other segments, all the segments, the five-infrast systems was increased its revenue. Operating income was 45 billion yen. There were the revenue increase on top of that. Weaker yen had positive impact at 41.9 billion yen increase year over year. The non-overading income and loss related to, for example, equity method companies such as Kyokxia, there's a positive of 37.1 billion yen. In total, income before income taxes was 82.1 billion yen, which is an increase of 62 billion yen. After that, income taxes were deducted and the net profit for this year is 59.8 billion yen, which was an increase of 56.3 billion yen year over year. Moving on to page 7, This is the operating income analysis compared to a year ago. Far left is the first half operating income of FY 2020, which was 3.1 billion yen. During the first half of FY 2020, the restructuring cost of 7.8 billion was posted, so we reversed back this amount and the operating income with that impact of restructuring cost was about 11 billion yen. And there are recovery from COVID pandemic and there are 40 billion yen of the revenue will be added and, presumably, the revenue is approximately 50 billion yen. And according to our business plan, in order to streamline the overseas offices and locations, we have posted about 5 billion yen worth of a restructuring cost, and therefore, as a result, operating income for the first half of FY21 was 45 billion yen. As is mentioned at the outset, there are more visible impact arising from bessoring material and logistics costs as well as semiconductor shortages. And as this boxes on top of the chart explained that a shortage of the semiconductor products is affecting as a reduction of the revenue as a result the revenue negative impact was about 6 billion yen. On that hand, the soaring material and logistics cost is considered as a part of the cost increase as a result. The cost increase was about 14 billion yen. At a total, there was the income reduction impact of 20 billion yen also. On page 8, non-operating income, as I said earlier, the equity in earnings of affiliate improved because mainly due to the yield set increase of profit by 16.8 billion yen. Therefore, for the first half in fiscal year 2021, that 37.1 billion was recorded up 20.1 billion yen from my ear earlier. Page 9, free cash flow positive 131.4 billion yen as I said at the outset and there was a cash out of the negative 53.1 billion yen cash flow from investing activities however due to that collection on AR at the end of a previous fiscal year in the receipt of the advances of large projects that cash flow from operating activities with positive 184.5 billion yen. And the bottom half provides the equity, attributable shareholders of the company, which decreased by 81.7 billion yen. The share equity due to the share repurchase of 100 billion yen, an ear-end special dividend payout of 81.7 billion yen, and 1 trillion and the 45.2 billion yen was recorded. And the shareholder equity ratio was 30.5% and page 10 is the breakdown of what we have already explained and the shareholders equity ratio the net interest of bearing debt was 47.5 billion yen. And page 11, explanation by segment and page 12 is also by segment. As I explained earlier, excluding infrastructure system most increased in both sales and profit. And here is the energy system on page 13. Net sales was 236 billion yen, operating income was 4.5 billion yen. Net sales increased by 45.9 billion yen from a year earlier, as you can see here. The net sales increase in both power generation system transmission and distribution. Given this increase in net sales, operating income also improved by 12 billion yen from the previous year. Page 14. The top half provides infrastructure systems and solutions. Net sales were 272.1 billion yen, operating income was 0.3 billion yen. Public infrastructure, sales increased however in industrial systems with impact of pandemic still remaining and the net sales in the entire segment decreased by 9.9 billion yen and operating income as well on top of the decrease because of the decrease in net sales and cost of restructuring industrial systems. And recently there was an increase in cost in overseas projects in railways, therefore segment as a whole, so the decrease in operating income by 6.2 billion yen for the first half. The bottom half provides the results for building the solution. Net sales were 285.8 billion yen and operating income of 10.2 billion yen. Net sales recovered mainly in the air conditioning business and therefore net sales increased by 26.5 billion yen. And on the other hand, operating income due to the increase in net sales. And although there were negative impacts of the material cost increase and a logistic cost increase, and its impact of shortage of semiconductors, elevator escalator, business in particular, and also impacts of the forex and the ordino operating income was almost a flat. On page 15, device and storage net sales were 432.9 billion yen, which was up 108.9 billion yen from a year earlier. operating income was 34.7 billion yen, which is up 30.1 billion yen year on year. Semi-conductors and hard disk drive net increase, net sales increase mainly due to the recovery from the impact of pandemic and driven by the increase in sales and the impact of the forex and also effects of the restructuring which was conducted last year, income increased and in others and had a risk. In the same period last year, the operation ratio of the plant in the Philippines was reduced, the significant due to, mainly due to pandemic. Therefore, there was an increase of sales to data centers during this fiscal year. The gross ratio has been significant. Site 16. The upper half is retail and printing solutions. It sells 221.7 billion and operating income 4.3 billion. So it is in black compared to last making last year. Similarly, recovery from the COVID and also last year we conducted the restructure reform with this retail and both printing has achieved an increase in sales and also income. The bottom half is digital solutions. Mainly by the increase of the Page 17, amount of orders received and also the order backlog for the three years the trend is given on the left is the amount of orders received. For the first half the orders received compared ear on ear 19%, mainly in the energy system similar to FY19. In FY21 as well, there were orders of large scale projects. And if you move to the right part, which is the order backlog, order backlog also is steadily increasing. Then, please take a look at page 19. It is the equity earnings from Kyoksea. And for the figures I already mentioned earlier, if you take a look at the right part, BitGross and also ASP difference change is given in the bold font is that for the BID growth higher 10% range we are seeing quite a growth and for ASP, mid-single digit increase. Compared to three months before, first quarter, the price increase is becoming more slower. Page 20 explains about how we completed our share-repurchase plan. Site 21 and beyond is about the full-ear forecast for FY21 full-ear. For net sales, $3,350 billion yen. And compared to what we announced three months before, it is an upward revision of $100 billion. For income before tax and net income as Kyuxia's portion is unknown for the six months ahead. So this is just as of reference. In the first half, there was a 200, excuse me, 20 billion upward revision from Kyokxia equity earnings. So we have made an upward revision for the income before tax and also net income. For operating income and free cash flow, we maintain the previous forecast and there is no change. Site 23 is a forecast by segment. At the very right column, it gives the difference between the previous forecast and ounce three months before. A little lower than the middle divides and storage. For the revenue, 80 billion upward revision for net sales. However, having said that, out of this 80 billion, Kyokia memory resale is still included, which accounts for about half. So in real terms, semiconductor or hard-ride related gross increase in revenue is about 40 billion. And one column above retail and printing solutions, As Toshibatak already announced their figures and their overseas retail is very strong also with the Wieger Gänd we have made an upward vision of 20 billion. As they made this upward vision, we also reflected the same. And as I mentioned, for the company wide, operating income, no change, but by segment building solutions, especially retail printing, toshiba tech, because of the soaring material and logistic costs, lack of semiconductors, each segment compared to the previous announcement made a downward revision by 5 billion. On the other hand, in the first half, device and storage has been very strong, so in net it is a 15 billion increase in profit. Slide 24. Similar to first half analysis on the left is FY20, 104.4 billion operating profit and we had 17.5 billion restructuring cost. So this is reversed. It will mean that we have an operating profit income of 120 billion. In addition to this, if you go a little to the right on a planned basis we have the restructuring and 21 billion. Also, excuse me, restructuring cost of 10 billion and also fixed costs increased for 21 billion, half of that, at depreciation and also half is for R&D. With these expenses cost increasing, but with the increased in revenue and also with the effect of the restructuring, which will offset the increase of a cost and 170 billion profit is achievable. Lack of semiconductor and also the soaring material price, as I mentioned earlier, that is illustrated in the balloon. So that was about the second quarter results explanation. Thank you very much. That concludes the presentation part of the session. Now we'd like to move on to the Q&A session. And the question will be taken by Mr. Chirakawa, Mr. Atazawa, Mr. Hirataa, as well as the four members joining via online. And when there are questions, please state your name. Now, we will have 30 minutes questions to be picked up from the members of the field media. and let me label it on the message of taking questions. The questions are only be collected from the people who were registered beforehand and if you have any questions please press Asterix and 1. It is not a pound, but it is the Asterix. The moderator will call out your name and therefore please start your question. If you would like to retract your question, please press the answer to answer it. During the Q&A, please stop the audio from the internet. There might be some feedback if your phone picks up the audio from that website. If you're not speaking and hearing the answers, please mute yourself in order not to disrupt by the noises from your end such as typing keyboards. Now we'd like to enter the conventions from Mr. Yao of Niepon Niekei. The Seheyo of Niekei. can you hear us? Thank you very much for the presentation. First off, regarding the separation into three entities, what are the flows of discussion that resulted in this conclusion? Well, between the Saba is a question of the Now, this is Sunakaba. May I answer to your question. Now, as is mentioned earlier, executive side and also the board meeting have had the meetings almost every week for the last five months. There were many strategic options that we discussed and also that were reviews of the medium term plan that we have compiled. And also we at the SRC had had a discussion about the potential privatization with partners, so we have compared many options. Now, we came in regard to the ideas of tax-free spin-off while we were discussing discussing and after the end of the discussion between SRC and the board we came up with this idea. And as PowerPoint had mentioned the executive CM management side had a very confident in pursuing this option of the tax-free spin-off. I believe that this is the best possible path forward for Toshiba. That is all. Thank you very much. Are there any other options that we have discussed? Could you elaborate on that? Could you repeat the question? So when the spinoff idea surfaced and SRC or the CMS meant who was the first one to say? And were there any other options regarding other options? Well, SRC will issue a report at a later date about how the discussion has developed. It was about 10 pages long, a document that we intend to publish in due course, but it was several months ago that this particular idea surfaced. And SRC, we at the management and advisors, all parties involved and made a discussion. In the course of the whole discussion, we came up with the idea of tax-free spin-off and the feasibility of that idea was recognized as a viable option and ultimately we came up with the idea of a separation into the Now regarding the future growth, now spinoff is just talking about the institution. It is means, but how are you going to make growth in real-term basis that I'd like to explore with you? Reason is that in regard to the Tushma Next Plan in FY25, $4 trillion of the net sales and $400 billion of operating income and 10% of operating income margin, that was a target. And a total of the three entities, you'll be able to exceed that initial target. And in the case of the changeable, the source of growth is coming from the technology developed by R&D. And what is the source of the development and how you're going to separate that into three entities? Could you enable it on that? I think the answer is that the question is to talk about the growth potential. And as page 8 describes, there are three rectangles. And from left and right, real-to-use speaking, that these are considered shareholders where we are changing the entity entity structures and simplify the operation so that we can materialize the value and thereby providing more options for the shareholders. But in regard to the growth of the square in the middle, where the forecast and agile management, that will be the largest difference vis-à-vis other ideas. To give you some specific ideas, and for example, as Misha Hatazawa mentioned earlier, the power semiconductor to be grown and then the investment into 300 millimeters was made. And that is something that I reflect upon now that semicher is in shortages nowadays and in retrospect probably a year before our decision or at least six months before our actual decision that the investment had had to be made but there were headquarters and the substrates and there are the topics, the intermediates and others. And therefore, it took quite a long time to make final decisions. And in terms of agility, there are something that we have personally flipped upon. And therefore, looking at each market, the competition situation and the peers that are competitive landscape that we need to carefully look at and the focus and the very small management will have to make very agile decisions so that we can compete well in the global market. So that's why we decided to separate the entities in this way. I personally believe that so. And in regard to a next question, how the number will play out? In regard to the specific targeted numbers when we discussed with Sheahorus as SRC has mentioned earlier that Toshiba always make the three-year medium-term plan in the year three, so we had never had achieved the results and the target. And that was actually a criticism that we have to face up. And we are thinking about the feasible number, and we incorporate that into this presentation. I just wanted to add that to my comment. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. As explained by Mr. Nakawa earlier regarding the statement by the Board. It has been already released on our press release webpage titled, The Processes Reading to the spin of plan by the board of directors of the company and that is already released on our website. Bloomberg, Mr. Furukawa, this is Furukawa of Bloomberg speaking. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. I have two questions. May I ask two questions at once? Yes, please. I have questions to Sena Kawasan regarding this reorganization. I understood advantage is very well, but changing the organization of the company. There will be risks incurred and potential demerits as well. In reorganization process, I think that you are going to explain this to employees and other stakeholders like business partners. Do you think that the all stakeholders will understand this and accept this? the shares will be partly purchased and most of the net proceeds will be returned to the shareholders. And this time are you going to divest all the shares held by the company and could you please explain whether the plan stays unchanged and an IPO policy related to Kyokxia, and do you still keep the strategy or policy to keep the Kyokxia IPO? And regarding merits and demerits and in the competitive landscape there are advantages regarding the creative capabilities of Toshiba. As in the question asked by the reporter from Nikkei, I couldn't respond to that regarding the research laboratories. Were there any concerns about that? He asked that question as well. And researchers and staffers in principle'm going to be divided into two companies, standalone companies. There needs to be a system of process allowing the exhibition of capabilities and we would like to work out the details related to the basic research at the research laboratories and that is the remaining challenge for us. We have to work on that but in principle, staffers will be divided into two standalone companies to promote individual companies. Semi-conductor energy and infrastructure, the core weight of the management strategy will be changed. But we believe that the disadvantage will outweigh disadvantages. And as you said, we would like to come up with a system to improve the situation related to any potential disadvantages in your question. Regarding your second question about Kyokse, whatever which will exceed the appropriate level of capital will be returned to shareholders. And earlier, a majority of stake, the net seats proceeds from the sale of the Kyok's shares will be returned to shareholders and considering the current financial position. Everything in excess of the appropriate capital, well, we thought that even if when we return all the proceeds from the sale to shareholders, we would be able to sustain the financial structure. So this time we said that all the proceeds will be returned to shareholders. Of course anything related to the spinoff will be kept. The IPOs policy which they unchanged. This is to be determined by Bing. Therefore, this is not something we are able to determine. But following the decision by Bing, we like to be cooperative with them so that we can be prepared. Thank you. Next NHK, Schmeissmann, please. This is Schmeiss from NHK. Do you hear me okay? Yes. I would like to ask Snagara-san. It is about disadvantage of the separation plant and there was a mention about the R&D. It's a three trillion yen cell size by splitting that, separating that. So size-wise, it will be smaller, first of all. So, but still, do you believe that you will be viable with the smaller size? And also, I would like to ask, Mr. Broff is that privatization has been often mentioned and this time, so the three entities being listed. So that is quite the contrary with privatization. So have you given up with the privatization and if you have given up with the privatization, so what was the reason in the cause? So can I hear from him? So first Mr. Srinakawa will respond and then we will be switching the image camera and also the voice to connect to Mr. Brof. So the question was about threegen being split and separated if whether we are concerned about that. For energy, infrastructure business, 2 trillion worth of business in size and semiconductor device, 4- device storage 1 trillion, a little less than 1 trillion. So this is sizable quite sized and we are aiming for a fresh start. And so we are willing to start a very fresh start for the financial position so we do not have any concerns. On the other hand, the two entities will be able to have a very agile management in their business and a very focused manner that is in a large advantage. So I think I will switch to Mr. Brof, switching the image and also the voice. Thank you Chairman. As Chairman Sunakawa has mentioned we have uploaded this afternoon the SRC's 10 page letter, which I think is probably unprecedented, explaining the journey that the SRC as well as the board has been through for the last five months. And within that letter, you will see a section related to the potential privatization of Toshiba and all of the work that we did on that particular option. But what we ultimately decided was that the plan that we presented today, the separation plan offered more flexibility to our shareholders and was in fact better as far as a long term growth and value of the sheba corporations concerned. So we believe the plan is the best for our shareholders. When we began the SRC exercise, there was a view expressed by some shareholders, but not all that we should be going straight to an auction process. But frankly, our fiduciary duties require us to explore all options and through that process the separation plan was developed. The reason for the separation plan is actually explained in the letter and it arose from with the strategic partners in a very deep manner for a stage, second stage, third stage, and many layers. There was discussion and each partner, example regulatory risk also about the antitrust also Kyokzvya that the price is difficult and unclear and we did not come to a very clear cut pricing. And that is also mentioned in the report. So I hope that you will read to the report. That is all for myself. So did you say that with the partners you already had discussion with about the general shareholder meeting? Do we are confident in what we have announced and explained and we are asking for the endorsement and to seek opinions from these shareholders we are expecting to hold EGM during January March. Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity. May I ask a question to Mr. Tuna Pava, separation into three entities. When we look at it from a different point of view, General comprehensive electric company, that idea has already been given up on and then this is a despondent of the company. What do you think of this opinion? Well, let me answer that being a comprehensive electric trucking company, be it a TV, a personal computer, and home appliances and medical that I used to belong to. There's nothing of the business already. And therefore, we are no longer comprehensive electronic player. However, social infrastructure and device business in semiconductors, these two entities, you mentioned that this is the disbandment, but in my opinion, this is the evolution for the future. So it is not the dismodlement, but it is the evolution for the future. So we would like to be very confident in moving forward to the future. May I ask a second question if I may? Now, the reorganization plan this time, what is the impact of the employment as well as the closure of your operating sites. Well, impact on the employment, I would not expect so, but that also requires a further explanation to the society at large. So that's the policy that we'd like to take going forward in regard to the closure of the operating sites. The plan does not complete with the announcement of the plan. Announcement of the plan is the starting point for the future evolution. This is the starting point for further development. And therefore, we will continue with the portfolio review, Kefto allocation policies. And we are poised to do that going forward. And on top of that, it's necessary. There's nothing be decided at this point in time, but we may conclude that perhaps the closure of the site is more rational, but we have started our path toward evolution. And therefore, in the Minister of our course of actions, there will be other opportunities as well. Last question, if I may. The governance enhancement committee report that I'd like to ask about in In that report, the former senior executive officers have engaged in acts in violation of the corporate ethics. And based on that, although the duty was already released from the former executives and still you are asking for them to pay back their renumerization and also the some damages are loaded to be made and what do you think of that? Well, first, the reason of the report was compiled that perhaps induced by the independent investigative report that perhaps the AGM wasn't organized in a fair manner, such as interfering with the voting activities of the shareholders and so forth. And then we, as a company, committed to the receipt of the independent investigative report in the very shares in CCI-Amana. It is not the legal decision whether that was acceptable or not. It is just the fact that we received the report from investigators and also some of the board's traits were rejected by the Shearihuruz and we believe that the pressure issue was the covenants issue of this company. That is awareness. So it wasn't about what had happened in the past. It was about the evolutions for the future. And without having the redevelopment of the governance structure of this company, the supply and supply will not be executed quite well. And therefore, as soon as possible, we would like to reorganize or redevelop the governance structure of this company. The full report of the governance enhancement committee was now published and I look at the fourth quarter regarding theatter regarding the recurrence prevention measures. And there were four major points was raised and how we are going to rebuild the governance of this company. How are we going to rebuild the governance? I'd like to highlight in my activities going forward in the company, I do not intend to just reflect upon what had happened in the past. We just make very sincere reflection about this. And it always, the case that the company would say that we thought something bad had happened and we will change going forward. That's not what we are going to do. We will do a serious exercise of such as brainstorming and discussions and we would like to be very strenuous of implementing the Recurrence Permission of Materials and I would like to spend a lot of time for that. Are you suggesting that what had happened has a bygone? So bygone speed bygone and you are going to focus on more forward-looking actions going forward. Is that a case? Well, compensation committee as Ms. Waddahiki mentioned, perhaps a compensation committee may discuss something about what had happened in the past, but personally, I've actually just count on the presidential committee for the decisions to come in the future. Kaudot. I have question to Mr. Tsubnakala regarding this decision. In the process leading to this decision, the completion of the board has been reduced from 13 by 5 members. And, Tana Khalsan, you are serving as the president as well, and on the board as well. So, I wonder how this decision was reached. So could you please give us your take on this? Yes, Chairperson of the Board is served as a temporary position and also for the President position. We needed to find a successor as soon as possible. Of course, the successor plan is being formed by any company. So anyway, this is something that should be determined by the nomination committee. So I will follow the decision by the committee. But for the current position and duties and responsibility, I would like to dedicate myself to fulfill these duties. So do you have the idea that you are going to continue to serve in order to accomplish this spin-off. Well, at the board, the current board serving, well, I think that by when I'm going to serve on the board, this is to be determined by the nomination committee's soul. But as far as we have this plan for the spinoff, and I would like to continue to dedicate myself. And Mr. Krumatami resigned. And he was engaged in saying that he will respect the engagement with shareholders. And I think that if there was no influence by the activists, do you think that you didn't? You had been reaching this decision this time around. Well, when you say activists, and in this process, we could learn a lot from the engagement with shareholders, particularly in relation to governance. There are many things that we could learn. Irrespective of whether or not shareholders are active or not, but this time in order to enhance the value of the company and to enhance the shareholders' value, we believe that this was the right decision three years ago in 2018. Toshiba Nextplan was formulated and at that time, the company's goal was to, through maximization of corporate value, TSL, total shareholder return is to be enhanced. This is what we said. So TSR or shareholder value to be maximized. That is what we said. And this policy has not changed at all. And this time, for the purpose of increasing the shareholder value or expanding the CSR, and this separation plan is very reasonable towards the future. We needed to make evolution. We believe that this is a very important one step towards that. Thank you very much. From Diane Monde, symbol Nissan, please. From Diane Monde, Simbogisan, please. From Jaya Monde, my name is Simbogie speaking. On a related note, I would like to ask, is it about the top management positions and I do have several questions. Within the ear to find a successor and also the chair of the board meeting and I understand that it will be difficult to find a successor within the calendar year. I would like to know whether that is correct and also what the reason. And perhaps Mr. Braff from the nomination committee or anyone who is suitable to answer. I hope that would be answered. And also my next question is about the separation plan into three entities about the President, CEO and the would that impact the finding the successor of the chairman and also when do you want to decide on the new management? So at the first question, we would like to ask Mr. Bofta and please wait as we will be switching the image and also the line. With regard to the separation plan, we should be able to recruit and retain people with more specialist skills rather than the generalist skills that are needed to run a conglomerate. And once we have the support of our shareholders, we will be on a course to start recruiting people for our respective boards. But that's a little bit early in the day at the moment. But of course the intention is to have appropriately qualified boards with industry experience to to run those two spindle businesses. I think beyond that we are going to go to our shareholders for an EDM in March. I think once we've got that endorsement we should be putting forward some more candidates for Toshiba Corporation 6502 to assist the board in particular with regard to the audit committee. Thank you. Excuse me, the EGN should be much and the translator mistakenly announced that it was May. About the outside board, directors deciding by December that plan and there was a question on that point and the reason. So this time, there's much strategic options and we had this change in course and within the process unless it was fixed and as we were not able to recruit and appoint someone so that was what was mentioned at the nomination committee. I am not a member of the nomination committee. So the first priority was placed on to creating and specify the separation plan that was the priority. That was the supplementary explanation. So, in that example, we will move to the next question. Next, take a look at the view of Kisei, please. Can you hear me? Yes, very well. This is Takaji of To You, Kisei. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would like to follow up the previous question. May I ask once again and confirm. Now, the chairperson of the company, for your company, what is the selection process? Well, the question is that, is itan Sun, are you going to serve as an intermature present to you until the spirit separation of the companies? May I confer once again? And I'd like to ask another question at this juncture that the company will be separated into three entities. And the third one, which is considered to be the current Toshiba portion, that the Kyokshia's Aztecs will be owned and also Toshiba Tech shareholder is going to be Toshiba. But do you think that Toshiba will disappear in the future? I just wondered the chairperson and CEO in the future regarding that outside the lecturers are comprising the nomination committee so it is up to the nomination committee's decision so at this point in time there's nothing that we know of and therefore it is up to the nomination committees to discuss going forward. Now regarding what would happen that the legacy Toshiba, what would happen on that entity, will the Toshiba, will earn the ownership stake of Kyokxia and for Kyokxia's ownership, we would like to monetize into the cash as soon as possible. And for Toshiba Tech, positioning is completely different. Well, Kyoksha is a pretty method applicable company and the Toshiba Tech is fully consolidated, listed as a subsidiary. What we call data business, for, there's nothing decided at this point. We are working on digitalization at the data business and Toshiba Tech learns many data and Toshiba Tech Business is indispensable for Toshiba overall. So what would happen for that entity? Currently there are the heavy data and also brand management issue as well. We need to discuss about the details going forward. So that is the current situation. Thank you. Now, do you have clear pathways for the investors and so forth? No, none. Are you asking about tech? Correct. The tech for the Tochua Tech, nothing is decided. May I ask a further question. Relationship of the three entities. Once these are spin off and it will be different independent entities. I'm not sure if legally a level or not. However, for example, cross-holding about shares, for example, among the three entities, would that be a viable option under the laws in regularization Japan, cross-shareholding of three entities as impossible? So we will not have a cross-sharing of the shares. Thank you very much. Next TV Tokyo, Abesam, please. This is Abbe of TV Tokyo. Can you hear me? Yes. In this press conference that materials are titled the transforming toshi bat to enhance shareholder value. And it used to be to enhance corporate value, but it has been changed to enhance shareholder value. Is it correct? Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure. The shareholder value should be enhanced. That was the word we finalized and by maximizing corporate value and then shareholder value will be also enhanced. So, in the end, ultimately shareholder value will be enhanced. As the means to do that, and then corporate value should be increased, so TSR should be expanded. So, as the final point to reach, we wrote the shareholder value. The reason why I asked this question, according to what I heard from the company's people and the current management team, maybe people are looking only towards the shareholders within the management team, and that is the criticism that we have heard from the people in the company, activists, so particularly in particular shareholders are considered most, and in preparation of this material. So, Naka-wasa, you mentioned that there are a lot of discussions, management team and the topic sectors of the subsidiaries and so forth. So, have you, I believe that there was only limited discussion with the top executives of the subsidiaries or operating companies and it was out of the blue for them. Do you think that you have obtained understanding from the internal people about this plan. We have been continuing to say, since three years ago when Toshiba next to plan was announced, that TSL should be enhanced. We have been keeping to say the same thing, but of course, shareholders, stakeholders, stakeholders, but of course, the society at large and employees, all the stakeholders should be valued. And this is our policy, which has stayed unchanged. and this time again, we do not change this policy at all by having this separation into three companies and then we believe that we will be able to provide appropriate services to customers and there will be incentives and various benefits and merits for employees as well, based upon the business cycle of each company after separation. And as an overall, for all the stakeholders, we believe that this decision is going to be the best option. Current shareholders will obtain the shares of the two standalone companies which will be listed on the market. Regarding the percentage, the mix or percentage of the shares to be allocated, do you think that this will be reflecting the current values? Well, I think that will be determined when the spinoff is completed. We do not have anything that has been clarified. Well, nothing clarified. Then the structure of the shareholding ownership structure is different. But I think there will be an option for shareholders to choose. Based upon the same ratio, I think maybe I should defer this question to CHE4. So in two years, sometime in two years from today, the ownership structure will be divided, I mean shares of the Toshiba held by Sherwooders will be divided and Sherwooders will be provided with the different shares in each company, each entity. So it will depend on the decision of shareholders regarding what to do with those allocated shares. And I think there is uncertainty whether or not the company will be able to maintain R&D functions. For example, in the case of infrastructure company, infrastructure business and the QKD business of course quantum encryption it will cost a lot of money in R&D activities. So after separating into two entities and research laboratories will be also divided into two. So do you think that you can be able to maintain such capabilities that Toshiba cutting edge technology can be really maintained? I think there needs to be more clearer forecast or outlook regarding this. Okay, I'd like to defer to Hata Zavasan. Within the numbers represented, CAPEX, R&D expenditures are explained for the coming three years. And according to the current plan, the gross plan to be supported by the gross funds as you know to be spent in the R&D and the CapEx. So these are estimated to be more aggressively spent R&D expenditures. In addition to the ratio of R&D expenditure in the total sales, which has been increased by 1% or 2% point, so overall we are going to put more focus on the R&D. And in terms of division into device and infrastructure and content of the research, it will depend on the wear in the business areas such activities can be allocated to and then the expenditures or efforts will be divided. As Tuna Ka-san mentioned and basic research, we would like to avoid the negative impacts of the spin-off. We will consider that in the process of spin-off completion. And R&D is continues to be important for the company. So we will continue to be even more aggressively in spending in the R&D. Lastly, have you already reported this plan to Metis? If so, what was the feedback? What was the reaction from Metis? Yes, we went to explain this to them in advance. I don't think there was any negative feedback from them. Thank you very much. So it is about time, so we would like to take the last question, Nikke business, please. This is called a different Nikke business. Do you hear me okay? Thank you. So I have three last questions, two to Snakasan. So by the Kyokse shares. So in order to solve the excessive net operating loss, I believe that it was being used. So we have the device company. So I don't think you need to be desperate to sell the shares. And if you keep the shares in stake, perhaps you can see some energy. But are you still willing to determine to sell the stake? And the second one is about the separation plan. So I think this special resolution will be required at the EGM, but I think that the special resolution to be attained is going to be very hard, high hurdle. And also, I believe that the split, the opinion is quite split. Is that is what I heard? Within the SRC, so why not sell to the PE fund but this separation plan was supported? So could you reiterate the reason because I did not find and the explanation the reasoning? So could I be answered? So myself, Tanaka, about these Kyokseya steak shares. So why not seek synergy with the semiconductor business? Memory business will require massive investment and even with the current financial position we have decided no longer to continue and so instead to monetize the stake so that has been already decided from the before and there is no change to this policy and about the two-third special resolution 2023 so until that point as I mentioned earlier this reform is just the beginning and it is sort of a declaration and so in the meantime there will be further reform that is coming to come and will be executed also capital policy as well and also for the shareholders that we will be endorsed and be supported we will make the effort. And Mr. Buff could you respond please? The SRC's letter to shareholders, which was published this afternoon, goes into some detail about the process we followed with regard to private equity. It was quite an exhaustive process going through several rounds with credible bias and at the end of the day the separation plan came about principally because of the difficulty in valuing the keyoxious shares at this time. And the separation plan was therefore regarded as superior to the private equity plan from a quantitative and qualitative aspect. So if you like, the separation plan emerged from our earlier discussions with regard to the management plan, with regard to possible minority investors, and with regard to private equity solutions. That's how it came about. Thank you. Did I answer your question? Now we'd like to close the sessions for the media. Next, we'd like to invite the social analyst and financial institutions to take up some questions. So those of you who were not picked up as a questionnaire, please be trapped your questions by pressing asterisk too. Now we'd like to open the sessions for the analyst and the investors and please enter your question by pressing asterisk and one. City Group, EZawa San, please. This is EZawa of City Group. Can you all hear me? Thank you very much. Two questions at this point. Until recently, now, they clearly identified the Norcore business or the divestitures of some part of the business or possibly to discuss that the company is themes and now the company has concluded that the spin-off is a option. But in terms of the divestitures compared to spin-off, well, compared to the divestitures versus spin-off, why did you conclude that spin-off generates the larger upslides in the company's shareholder value? And what is the benefit of having split? So could you elaborate on that specifically? That is the first question. Second question is, pertaining to the presentation by Tineawa Sun at the outset that business portfolio will opt for further revisions and portfolio re-adignment going forward. That's how I understood your presentation. Ultimately, the Intosiable group, what would be the desirable ways of how told about would be like in the future? I think it would be beyond what you have decided on in two years time, beyond that, as a result of the spin spin off. Do you think that a complete and separate industry entity would be ultimate form of the company or do you see further realignment of the company? Do you have any visions beyond two years time? Now question one and two, I think some parts are interlinked so at the beginning in the medium term plan, inclusive known core and core, it is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and known core. It is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and noncore. But we tried to focus on what the companies they would be in the near future. So that was the focal point this time. And therefore, the identifying versus non-core that is actually on the ongoing discussion at this moment as well and we will continue that discussion going forward as well. So what we have announced this time is just a starting point of improving the value going forward. So there will be two new codes and as soon as possible, they will prepare the business plan on their own and we'd like to provide opportunities so that two new goals will be able to present their own business plan for the future. Going back to the first question, what is the strengths and what was the advantage of the split idea versus the divestitures. There are three squares in the previous presentations and IMCEO of this company and therefore cash flow from the main business is the core challenge for me and that is the main theme in my opinion and for forecast and agile business management. It's the very important point in my view. Sorry, I'm talking too long, but in retrospect, I've been serving as CEO and COO for a very long time for this company. And what I remorse about is that we were able to, you were not able to exercise the gross strategy property. So at the right timing, we'd like to make an investment at the appropriate timing. We'd like to be very agile. And we have very good technologies at the highest or top in the world and we'll be able to use our marketing capabilities in a very quick and agile way. A question remains as is. So because of this split at this time, I hope that a single management who have specialized knowledge about this area will be able to make a very agile decision. I hope that this particular shortcoming of myself will be resolved in the separation of the businesses. So I try to answer two questions at once. It didn't satisfy yourself. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next. From SMBC Niko Securities, Yoshizumi Sangh. This is Yoshizumi of SMBC Niko Securities. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First question is through separation to unlock value. What is the concrete image of unlocking value through spinoffoff, congruent merit discount will be resolved. I think that was the basis. So are you sure that this congruent merit discount can be resolved? So could you please give us your specific opinion? In fiscal year 2021-23, the operating income of 200 billion yen, which is rather conservative and infrastructure service in Roik, is still 10%. I think earlier, in fresh products, in be secured. So I think that there will be the improvement room. But after this split and then 10% ROIC and then do you think that the congruent merit discount can be really cleared or resolved? So this is my first question about your expectation on these points. Okay, I would like to respond first and I would like to ask Hata Zavasan to supplement. And this time, unlocking the value. This is the headline, but the purpose itself is not to resolve the congruent merit discount. We need to clarify the structure so that each individual standalone company will be able to manage their business respectively and easy to understand manner as a result the performance will be better. So it will lead to that resolution of the Congromeretta discount. This is what I am feeling. Regarding numbers. I said earlier the numbers that can be achievable because we have been pointed out about the lack of achieving whatever commitment we have been making in the past. So there was the criticism from the sources on the market. So that's why we came up with these numbers which seem to be sure to be achieved. Hatazawa is going to supplement and in 2025 and towards 2030 we presented a plan towards those years and internally we have that forecast or targets for 2025. And based upon the opinion from external parties, we were asked to secure the delivery on the committed numbers. So that's why we came up with the conservative plan. And we are showing the plan for the coming three years alone. And in fiscal year 24, 25, we have a plan inside the company and we'd like to disclose those plans that appropriate opportunity and we talked about the importance of investing in R&D activities and the results will be realized in fiscal year 24 and 25. And external parties, particularly listening to the voices of shareholders and within the short period of time until fiscal year 23, what can be achieved and what can be achieved in the short term should be presented. So you may think that these numbers seem to be a little weak, but I'm sorry, that was the basis for coming up with this number. And we wanted to incorporate some risk buffers. So that's why we came up with this plan. That's all. Thank you. Thank you very much. My second question is for CFO. In the coming two years share buyback in the level of 100 billion yen you said and is it related to the sale of the shares in Kyokia or it is not included in the buyback plan and utilizing NOL and then what will be the advantage benefits of the tax issues at the time of a sale. So a qualitative comment will be okay. So could you please give us your comment? Thank you very much for your question. Regarding your first question, as Mr. Akhava mentioned, at our company, we have a yardistic of so-called appropriate level of capital. So, capital exceeding that appropriate level will be returned to shareholders. That's what we have been saying as Hatatavasam mentioned earlier in 2021, this current fiscal year and this coming 22. In these years, we came up with this rather sure plan. Therefore, we will be able to achieve this net income number. So considering all these, and according to our calculation, we will be able to return in the order of about 100 billion yen to shareholders. So regarding the gains from the sale of Kiaoksha shares is outside of this number and regarding the NOL, net operating loss, as you know, according to the tax law for the current fiscal year, half of the amount recorded in the fiscal year can be utilized. So based on the balance sheet that there is a NOL in the amount of about 300 billion yen. So how and when Kyokshia, Kyokshia stake in Kyokshia can be sold at any point. So if at that time if we still have the NOL and then about half of the gains obtained through the sale of Kia or Kia or Kia or Kia will be offset by the NOL. Thank you very much understood. Thank you. Next. UBS. Yes, please. Thank you. UBS. This is Yesi speaking. Yes, we hear you. I have one question, but there are three aims in asking my one question. So this announcement about how management is done, also how the business exists, I am sure that there was a lot of discussion on these matters. So the ideal state of Tushiba, what do you believe is the most ideal? I know that it could be something unrealistic, but could you explain about the ideal state of Toshiba? The reason I am asking, there are three reasons. What do you think the issue of Toshiba is? And the process, not how you reflected, but if there's anything in a event that has led you to the process and also second part is that when selecting the management of the new separated company, when you want to hand over to the new management, what is your ambition? What is your hope that the new management to realize? And also the three part is that the USGE also have decided the separation. So I believe that separation spinoff is now being questioned and this is something beyond shareholders. So what is the significance meaning of separation? I understand being agile, that is one of the advantage, but also this hasn't said from the early 2000s. And so why now today separation spin off is being decided does that reflect something in society so these are my questions I would like to respond and if any of the two of my colleagues have anything to add. So what is the ideal state? So I know that this will differ, but for myself, when we have a business and we are trying to solve the social issues around us and that is what is happening on a daily basis and the repetition. Personally, the company brand that is nothing that is not where I am particular about. Well, medical social medical some went to kind of medical and would give it a COVID situation. And MRI, for example, very well, and a well positioned in Japan globally, which is very... And although I'm sad that Oshiba name is gone, but what I have done is contribute to society and see it growing that itself makes me very happy. So, in the same sense, in the same notes, that what we are doing in our business that our employees being satisfied and also contributing to society, I think that is the ideal way, ideal state. So even in the form that it is split into two or more with the name changes, but our mission itself, how we execute and realize the mission, I think that is the important part. And so I was questioning myself, what is the ideal state? I know that I'm talking a lot, so perhaps this will be my response. And also, so asked what I expect towards a future management, especially the largest issue is governance. So when it comes to governance, this is going to be the fundamentals in management and governance has pointed out that although it may take some time that we want to reconstruct the governance and also with a new company management. There was a mention about what type is suitable and it is mentioned sometimes we will see someone from the outside of the market and also something with the capability of the governance perspective that is going to be some of the basics requirements qualifications. And it was just by chance that GE also announced that Nikkeit-Sleeq with that we were a little earlier in with our scheme to be known I don't know if this answers GSE sense question, but that is my impression. Do you have anything to add? There's also a response. I think that what each individual will be answering will be different. So this is my personal view. Myself, I believe that Toshiba's mission and philosophy is that what is asked for by Toshiba and we have the responsibility to execute our responsibility. So that is what we are required of and that is the reason of existence. So that is one thing. On the other hand, what clients, customers request us? Sometimes the time is different and also the requirement is different, meaning that sometimes we cannot make a management decision which has been pointed out as an issue, I think this applies to GE. The management environment has changed. Speed is required. So not luck at time in the past with a lot of things mixed in between. We will not be able to catch up and we cannot make a pure decision in order to survive. So that is why I believe that spinoff or separation could be one of the trend. We have the infrastructure, energy, and serve the clients in this industry and we believe that Toshiba may have only the answer and for the device and discs and also for the future information society. What is required of Sushiva? We need to create the solutions in a quickly manner that is requested by our clients. I think that is what we exist for and that is the reasoning for why we have decided on this decision and also it matches the needs. Also, let me also say a few words. From a financial position perspective, from a shareholder, we have the agreed and also we want to steadily increase the value. That is also the mission of the company. For this to happen, as Hadazasan mentioned, we need to win the trust of our client's customers and also we have to deliver the products and services that is required of. And what is most important is that the employees also share the same mission, look at the same direction, be aligned in the same mission. So eventually that will lead to increase the value for the shareholders and unlock the values. There are various means to realize this and given the current situation of Toshiba, what we have been discussing and what we are trying to execute, this framework is going to be the best path forward for the shareholders. I personally believe so. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next, we would like to invite from Goldman Sachs Mr. Harada please. This is Harada speaking from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. Can you all hear me? Thank you. Now, I would like to ask one question. Now, my question may sound very similar to the previous questions. Now, Infra services and device that you are going to separate into. And Infra services company itself is considered a congruent in my opinion when looked at the business structure. On the global basis, for example, elevators could be the vestigers going forward or carve it out going forward and going forward. Do you think that further realignment of military services in scope or in your vision at this point? And in addition, there are many congruent matters based companies in Japan. Be good or bad. your company is having a connection with Métis, then in order to enhance competitiveness of the overall corporate Japan, perhaps the real momentum of the company's evolving whole corporate society in Japan is perhaps considered. Was that a part of discussion with them? And also being a part of the concept of the Messiah, the same management. would that be also something that you would consider if good opportunity arises, are you conscious of this type of operation or opportunity? So if for a structured company, there are a variety of businesses included. However, there are some common denominators, for example, be it services and subscription models. And it is quite a high potential of sharing the commonality across the different businesses and infrastructure services. But like I mentioned earlier, portfolio review exercise will continue and there's nothing that we have decided at this point in time and yet we'd like to continue to discuss going forward. Now regarding regarding the realignment of the industries in Japan, my position is at least that we reviewed all possible opportunities and options exhaustively, Think about all the stakeholders such as shareholder employees and society, a large customer and we'd like to review from that point of view. That is my position. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your comment. That is all. Thank you very much. Now, we'd like to entertain one last question at this point in time. SBI, it's an isam, please. Thank you very much. I have two questions regarding spin-off to list span of companies on the market. I am not experienced in this area so could you please give us timeline for new calls including their balance sheets. The treatment of such accounting will be starting from the third quarter of this fiscal year 21 and then in two years from today, and a spinoff will be completed. This is my understanding, is this correct? And the second question is about the company names of the new codes. Do you plan to name with Toshiba in the company's name, like Kyokshia or other? I think that in this scheme, I think the new company's name would be like the ones as Kyokxias. Regarding the timeline for the companies to be listed on the market, there needs to be a two-fiscal year is financial results to be audited. So therefore our target is in the second half of 23. Fiscal year 23, here are the some will supplement and regarding the company names, there is nothing that has been determined yet. We are going to 5. a little bit. I think on page 12 there was this schedule for timeline. We would like to observe and follow this timeline as much as possible and with some better ideas or devising the ideas we like to shorten this duration. As you can see here, there is a necessity for two fiscal years financial numbers to be audited. This is the requirement by TSE and for this fiscal year in 2022 the numbers operation is based upon the assumption that the current organizational structure will continue. And of course there are lots to be worked out with auditors and for fiscal year 2021 the financial results to be closed based on the current Toshiba organization and then that will be the basis for the new goals and then we would divide the numbers into two companies. Some point in fiscal year 2022, we like to finalize the numbers for the new companies to be established in parallel for fiscal year 2022 based on the current consolidation under the Toshiba group and financial statements will be prepared and based upon the three new codes we are going to create three separate financial statements so that we will be working in language the current timeline and regarding the internal control examination to be conducted by auditors as well. So of course for Toshiba Corporation on the current consolidation basis, of course we would continue operation for fiscal year 2022. So in parallel with that, based upon the new organizational structure, which will be created so that internal control will be functioning. So we will check whether internal control will be working well in those certain new organization structures. So it will be going to be complicated during 2022. Until the end of fiscal year 2022, current organization structure will be maintained. But in parallel, we will prepare gradually the separate balance sheets for three new companies. Of course, there are a lot to be done, but roughly speaking, this is our current plan. Thank you. Thank you very much. So otherwise as it will be the last. But there was one question left from the media, so we would like to take the last question. Mr. Vashoyo, do you see, are you still connected? So we will close the questions. So there is one correction. Snokeau are missioned. Is that about these spin off related? Is that there was a leak from the Nikkei article. It is not a leak by the company, so I want to make a correction. So thank you very much for all the participants coming to the press release and also those participating for the phone, please make sure that you hang off.\"}"

              "{'text': \" Now, it's time. May I start the presentation on Transforming Toshi Bata Enhanced Heroes Value and FY21 Second Quarter Consulated Business Results. We are organizing this presentation on online basis. From 4 to 5 o'clock, we will be presenting from our side and followed by 30 minutes question session for the middle of the media. The questions from Alice and investors will be accepted from 5.30 to 6 o'clock Japan time. Please be aware of that. Now, we will be collecting questions via telephone conferencing system. As is informed to you beforehand, the conference call system will require the pre-registration beforehand. Let me introduce the presenter today. President NCEO, Satoshi Tsunakawa. Corporate Senior Executive Vice President, Mamoru Hatazawa. Representative Jesus Officer, Corporate Executive Vice President, N C F O, Masayoshi Hirata. We have a chairperson of the strategic review committee outside director, Paul Broth. He is joining from Hong Kong online. My name is Hara of Corporate Communication Department. We are providing simultaneous transition, so if you are watching the live streaming in Japanese, you will be able to hear translation's voice. Please be aware of that. First, before going into Transforming Toshiba to enhance your host value, may I have Mr. Tanaka to see a few words upon the receipt of the report from the governance enhancement committee today. Mr. Senakawa, please. Now, first of all, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the company upon the report of the Government and Assessment Committee. First off, I would like to express profound appreciation to the members of the Government and Medicine Committee who have made tremendous efforts and time since their appointment to investigate the root codes of issue and raised in the investigation report, collodify where the response was utilized and compile recommendations for formulating the major's revenge recurrence. I recognize that the Toshiba's Government Assessment Committee, based on the strong belief that restructuring of the governance is essential for the revival of the Toshiba, has compiled a report for our future. In fact, no issue of illegality was discovered according to the report of the Government Enhancement Committee. Having said that, I feel as a part of the senior management of the company, I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the senior members of the company. I am extremely ashamed and embarrassed that the senior members of the company and their actions was concluded that an act as a whole violates the corporate ethics demanded by the market. We have just received a final report of the governance enhanced committee, but we will continue to discuss the governance seriously within the company based on the contents of the report, including recommendations for the formulation of the recurrence prevention measures. We believe that this recurrence prevention measures will form the very first step to restore the trust of the shareholders which have been restored so far. Now, one of the group's philosophy is doing the right thing. Many employees on the front lines of operations are working day to day based on this value. On the other hand, I believe that some of the members of the Single Management were acted quite differently from this velocity and that should be sincerely remorzed over. The Corporate Management is established based on the trust relationship with all stakeholders, the Government and Assessment Committee also pointed out that the importance of top at the tone and organizational leaders demonstrating their commitment to value ethics and integrity. Until now, the culture to recognize the mistakes and the very good communication so that anyone can raise opinions escalated to the higher level, but also we need to ensure the psychological safety of all employees. We will make persistent efforts in this regard. As I will announce today, our group decided to separate the energy infrastructure, business and storage device businesses that, they will be separate companies and aim for the IPOs independently. This is a draft exchange, but because these businesses will be separated and being independent. And therefore, the committed to people and committed to the future based on this philosophy under the new corporate culture, each business is poised to grow and this is a great opportunity. But beforehand, it is a critical mission of the Singapore government to enhance governance beforehand. It is a critical mission of the senior management to enhance governance beforehand. I appreciate your continued support and asking for your cooperation. Thank you very much. Next, we'd like to present on the transforming Toshiba to enhance Ashihori's value and Mr. Tuna Kawa will make presentations. Next, I'd like to explain on our new management policy titled, Transforming Toshi Bato Enhanced Childers Value. The corporate executive vice president, Hata Zawa, will also be presenting and also online, chairperson of the strategic Review Committee, Mr. Paul, will also be attending as well. Now, today, Toshiba Group has decided on its significant transformation to further refort for the future. Let me first introduce why this is the best path forward for Toshiba and our shareholders and what it means for our business going forward. And then we would like to invite Mr. Braff to explain on the evaluation made by the Strategic Review Committee. After that, Mr. Hadada will talk on what the business outlook will be. The that I'd like to explain. Now, at the Board of Directors Meeting held this morning, the decision was made for Toshiba's strategic reorganization to separate the businesses into two businesses as a result. There will be three standalone companies to be formulated. One is Insta-sexual service company, second is Device Company, and the third is Toshiba. As we conclude this strategic reorganization to be the best path forward for Toshiba and their stakeholders, we took into account the view of our important stakeholders and other stakeholders, as well as the business characteristics and the value chain of each of our diverse businesses. Over our history of over 140 years, Toshiba has constantly evolved to stay ahead of the times. Today's announcement is no different. Toshiba has built a portfolio of leading businesses, but in order to enhance our competitive positioning, each business needs greater flexibility to address its own market opportunities and challenges. The official names for the new companies will be announced in due course. Here is an overview of the three independent businesses. Infrastructure service company will consist of Toshiba energy systems and solutions infrastructure systems and solutions building solutions digital solutions and battery businesses and become a company with the forecasted net sales of 2.1 trillion according to the fiscal year's forecast. Its increased focus combined with its innovative technological solutions will enable it to play a lean role in driving the transition to renewable energy to meet ambitious global carbon neutrality goals and advancing infrastructure resilience as a leading player. Device company will be comprised of the Toshiba electric device and storage solutions business and become accompanied with forecasted net sales of 870 billion yen. Its products will be including powers and conductors, high-capacity, hard disk drives, HDD for data centers, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It will be a global leader in supporting the evolution of social and IT infrastructure. Toshiba will continue to hold the companies on ownership stake in Kyokshia holding cooperation and Toshiba tech cooperation. Toshiba will seek to monetize the share of Kyokshia at an appropriate timing. The separation, this time, enables us to better align each new company by its unique business characteristics. Infantasture service company really did business focus on the direct sale of equipment and the provision of solutions to specific customers. It has long business cycles that are more heavily dependent on negotiations between business parties than the market conditions at large. In addition, it will be a capital-light business, and there are also major differences to the extent in which we conduct customized production. In contrast, device companies primarily manufactures and sells devices such as semiconductors and other materials, its business cycles are shorter and can be impacted significantly by the market conditions. It will be a capital intensive business that requires scale of continuous production across multiple customer orders and relatively speaking, the large capital investment needs to be made in a very flexible manner. So objective of a spin-off, there are three reasons. First, the separation will unlock immense value by removing complexity. Second, it enables us to have a much more focused and agile decision-making and their management. And the third separation naturally enhances choices for our shareholders. Our board and management team firmly believe that the strategic reorganization is the right step for sustainable profitable growth for each of the businesses and the best path to create additional value for our stakeholders. For our shareholders, we will unlock value by having dedicated and well-skilled management teams. We will be able to provide our customers more innovative and tailored services and solutions to meet their evolving needs. Our employees will have the opportunities to work at more focused companies where they can gain more technical expertise and self-growth opportunities and have greater growth potential in their children's field. And the separation will benefit our community by providing more frequent solutions to solve social issues of carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience that we are all facing. We believe that there are three main benefits of the business separation. First, the standalone companies will have improved management and governance structures. Infrastructure service company and Device Company are expected to have dedicated management teams that bring deep industry knowledge with clear growth strategies. We will of course consider candidates from outside of the company for building new management structure. The new structures also will facilitate more agile decision making with greater focus and knowledge of their respective companies, customers and employees in addition new structure creates optionality for both new companies to make on separate and informed decision regarding potential strategic partners. Second, the standalone companies will have more effective, efficient and tailored capital allocation policies, more closely matching their industry peers. This will enable them to better explore options to optimize their cost of capital by managing their leverage and provide more direct engagement with the capital markets and increase the ability to target that inequity investors which could drive additional cost savings. And the third and certainly not least, we will be able to increase shareholders' return to Siva intense monetize shares and key auction while maximizing the shareholders' value and return the net The that doing so does not interfere with the smooth implementation of the separation. This will increase the return to Toshiba shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone companies. In addition, this will facilitate fair value by providing compelling investment opportunities that meet different preferences of the shareholders' investors. So, Shiba has recently beat up a strong track record of creating returns for In the last four years, we have steadily increased our dividend payment from 30 yen per share in FY 2018 to an expected 80 yen per share in FY21. In Gaddeshan, the special dividend of 110 yen per share had already been provided during FY 2021. Toshiba has also maintained a commitment to return excess capital to shareholders. We bought back 700 billion yen worth of the shares in 2019 and another 100 billion yen in 2021. Capital in excess of appropriate level of capital will be used to provide shareholders' return, including the share buyback in FY22, as well as in FY23, to the extent that it will not interfere with the smooth execution of our business and business separation. The expected amount is going to be about 100 billion yen. In addition, we will utilize appropriate level of levelages and continue reviewing of business portfolio including consideration of the divestiture opportunity. A strategic reorganization this time is the last step in Toshiba's commitment, latest step in Toshiba's commitment to creating and returning Shearhood's value. In this panel, we working with the relevant authorities and advisors to determine the best and the most effective and efficient way to spin-off the business with an intention of effective transaction in a tax-qualified spin-off structure pursuant to the recent tax reform legislation in Japan. We will continue to keep you updated as we move through this process. The timeline is that every organization is expected be completed in the second half of the fiscal year 2023, subject to a shareholders' food and in obtaining approval from the relevant authorities. However, we will make an effort to speed up the processes to the extent that is feasible. Moreover, we are considering seeking for shareholders to vote on it at the proposed extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders expected in the first quarter of the next calendar year, if possible. A board steering committee is expected to be formed, which will include strategic review committee members in order to provide continuity and accountability for the successful completion of the B operation. In terms of the costs associated with the spin-off, we expect to incur 10 billion yen from FY21 onwards. The spin-off costs are expected to be offset by reducing SDNAA expenses in each business's base on peer benchmarks. Now, over the past year, five months or so, we have proactively evaluated a full range of options to enhance shareholders' value. Following the strategic review committee's thorough evaluation, the board concluded that the strategic organization is the best path forward for Toshiba and its shareholders. Representing the Toshiba's management, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Braff and Chairperson of the Strategic Review Committee. On behalf of the board member, I would like to once again express the profound appreciation for your efforts and time spent through the evaluation of the wide-ranging Valley Enhancing Options over the years. Now I would like to call upon Mr. Braff to comment directly on this plan. the you all for attending. The Committee is confident the separation plan is the optimal path to value creation for all Toshiba shareholders. As Mr. Sunakawa outlined, the plan will create three independent entities, each of which will be better organised, equipped and focused to unlock shareholder value more effectively than the company can do in its current form. With greater focus and a strong foundation, each business will be better positioned to invest in future, consistent growth with this individual needs and capital allocation profile. This focus will generate more growth and innovation for customers, new opportunities for employees and potential to serve their communities and the world. In addition, shareholders will be able to benefit from the conversion of Toshiba's shares in Kiaoxia into cash, from which all net proceeds will be returned to shareholders. The significant net operating losses after SHIBA will be utilised to offset capital gains tax liabilities. This will increase returns for the SHIBA shareholders while allowing them to participate in the continued upside of the two standalone businesses. This will also facilitate value creation by compelling investment opportunities that meet the different preferences of shareholders and investors. The separation plan represents a significant inflection point in our evolution, a bold new initiative that capitalises on the government's recent actions and looks beyond the confines of past Japanese business practices. The novel nature of this step for a company of Toshiba's importance is indicative of Toshiba's determination to follow the best course for long-term shareholder value creation. We undertook a rigorously objective process to arrive at this conclusion, including receiving input from a broad group of shareholders and both strategic and financial investors. We very much appreciate the views and perspectives that are reflected in the development of this plan. After comparing this plan to a wide range of other alternatives, we concluded that this approach provides shareholders the greatest potential for value enhancement with significant flexibility and opportunity for increased returns. This is by no means the end of the SRC's work. We shall continue to oversee the preparation of the separation plan until the shareholders vote on this at the proposed EGM in the first quarter of next year. At that point, it is expected that a board steering committee will be formed, which will include SRC members in order to provide continuity and accountability of a successful completion of the plan. Our collective backgrounds include highly relevant experience and expertise, and we expect to be supported in this effort by external expertise. We expect to be supported in this effort by external experts and newly recruited executives to help round out the existing management team. In conclusion, I would like to convey my personal conviction as Chairman of the SRC, that it is absolutely the right time to set forward for Toshiba and an exciting, energising and critical one that will launch the company on a compelling new value creation paths. We look forward to continuing our work and working closely with Mr Sunakawa, the board and the management team as we implement the separation plan. And we look forward to hearing your reactions and responses and receiving your support at the forthcoming EGM. Thank you. Now, going back to the representation material, transforming Toshiba to enhance your whole value, I would like to call upon Mr. Hatazawa to explain the strategy. Good afternoon, I am Hatazawa. As Mr. Tanakawa just explained, Toshiba will spin off its two business operations to infrastructure service company and device company for evolution into the future. The next three years will be an important three years to ensure spin-off and to lay the groundwork for growth after spin-off and to transform ourselves for the future. I will explain on this important plan for the next three years. Please note that, figures shown under this section are based on the current organizational structure and only covered a period of three years from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023. We expect financial improvements will further accelerate once the separation is completed. We intended to announce a more refined management plan for each new company on a separate occasion at a later date. First, infrastructure services company will help our customers and partners achieve their ambitious sustainability goals. We are ideally positioned to address two important social issues, carbon neutrality and infrastructure resilience and related needs of our customers. Infrastructure service company will utilize its customer knowledge and technological expertise to exploit such business opportunities in order to assist them in these areas. And we understand that the key to growth in energy and infrastructure lies in the intersection of AI, security and platform technologies. The conversion to cyber-physical solutions business is what we refer to as ex-digital. By working closely with our customers and partners, we will consolidate our domestic leadership in Japan and expand our global market share with focus in Asia. In the energy multiplied by digital domain, the realization of carbon neutrality is an urgent global issue for our customers. We already have a soundtrack record of delivering equipment and facilities to power utility suppliers as well as for EPC and maintenance services for power plants and in the transmission and distribution business. Further growth will result from the advancement of efficient use of energy through energy matting and energy management services. We will solve problems together with customers on both the power supply side and demand side. This is a huge market and we have new technologies to offer. Based on our vast experience working with partners, we will expand our business across the full value chain. Likewise, the infrastructure multiplied by digital domain offers us significant growth opportunities. We will create value for our customers by promoting optimal operation of infrastructure and achieve resilience by ensuring security. Already today, we have an established business model introducing equipment and facilities to infrastructure companies, including maintenance services. In the future, we will combine our operational knowledge and the digital technology specific to infrastructure users to provide asset management solutions including deterioration, diagnosis, O&M, automation and labor saving solutions and consulting to realize optimization of infrastructure operation costs and service usage costs. Our World Investment Plan for next three years underpinned our huge growth opportunities with about 500 billion yen, marked for CapEx R&D as well as M&A. We are eyeing to pursue a capital light business model for the infrastructure infrastructure service company with a medium to long term strategy. The infrastructure service company shows a solid financial profile and a strong growth outlook. The company expects net sales to grow at 3.3% compounded annual growth rate, CAGR, from $2.3.90 billion in fiscal year 2021 to 230 billion yen in fiscal year 2023. It also expects to improve operating income at 5% level much. And regarding free cash flow, we plan to improve free cash flow steadily and to maintain double digit ROIC at 10%. Device company. Device company will lead the evolution of social and information infrastructure through its semiconductor and storage businesses. Our leading products are significantly contributing to the wider society, including the realization of carbon neutrality. The strength of the business lies with its customer relationships, fears of experience with technology development, and capacity creation of production facilities, which we tend to expand with a sharper focus on its vast business cycle. We are well positioned as a global provider of leading products to transfer our technology further into profits and sustainable growth. In the field of power semiconductors, we will actively invest in the growth markets including the development of 300 millimeter line facilities and compound semiconductors, silicon carbide and gallium nitride. This will enable us to drive the acceleration of power efficiency, improvements in equipment and social infrastructure. We are targeting net sales of $120 billion in FY2023 compared with the $95 billion yen in FY21. Equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 13%. With expanding demand for data centers, along with the evolution of society's digitization, information infrastructure, significant market growth expected in storage business. Near line HCT through collaboration in the development of key components, advanced development in specialized areas and productivity improvement, rapidly expand the development of the high-capacity products and also strengthen support systems for data center customers. For Nearline HDDs, we have set a sales plan of 200 billion yen in FY21 and 280 billion in FY2023 equivalent to an annual growth rate of 18%. Prior to the separation, Device Company will invest to bolster its technological strengths in selected areas. In addition to expanding its Paris semiconductor production facilities, Device Company plans to increase the capacity of its semiconductor development facilities and the supply capacity of near line HDDs. In addition, its R&D focus will be on expanding its lineup and developing new models. We expect total investment of more than 300 billion yen in the three years till FY2023. For the device company as a whole, net sales at compound annual growth of 3.3% from $830 billion in FY21 to $880 billion to FY23. And excluding the growth for the transfer of memory, it is a 3.3% and operating income changes from 7.1% to 6.1%. However, if we take into consideration that the forex premise is 105 yen to the dollar in 22 and 23 and plan large investments during 2021 and 2022 for the growth beyond 2024, these needs to be considered and that the actual profitability is likely to improve. For the combined Toshiba group, in FY23, we are targeting net sales of 3.5 trillion, operating margin of 5.7%, REIC of 10%, pre-cash flow of 100 billion yen. As you can see from our remarks today, we are excited about the future. We look forward that through our spin-off plan the separation plan, that we will be able to deliver to all these stakeholders and that we will be transformative through this separation plan based on our management philosophy, are committed to people, committed to our future, we will continue to contribute broadly to society by creating a succession of new values and providing them to our customers. Thank you very much for listening. Next, we'd like to use the PowerPoint material titled F521 Second Quarter Consolidated Business Results. Mr. Hir, will be presenting on the results. Now, I Hirata will present on the second quarter results for FY 2021. Now, first, if you could turn to page 3, this is the key points of this result. Now, there are five key points. First point is regarding the fact that, for example, in the semiconductor business continuously from the first quarter, it is performed quite well in the second quarter and there is an improvement in energy business as well as a result during the first half of 2021. We were able to mark positive growth in revenue and income compared to the same period of last year. The sales revenue was $1,546.4 billion, with which a $175 billion increase of the revenue year over year. Now operating income was $45 billion,, which was 41.9 billion in increase compared to the same period last year. Now the second point is regarding free cash flow, which has improved due to the improvement of the EVDA and improvement in working capital due to the factors such as receipt of advanced payment. And here over here, we were able to see a great improvement. For the first half, that's positive 131.4 billion. That was an increase of 124.3 billion yen year over year. The third point is regarding order-taking. For orders which was increased very robustly due to a large scale project and it has increased by 19% year over year. Fourth point is regarding the forecast for the full year 2021. There are the surge in material and logistics costs as well as the shortage of a semiconductor product. And such impact is gradually visible. However, the semiconductor business of our company is performing well. It is offsetting the negative impact as a result of that operating income remains to be the same as the previous forecast at 170 billion yen. Next is the shareholders return policy. Now 100 billion yen of stock buyback as well as special dividend distribution of 110 yen was completed in the edition of the board organized today. We have approved of a 40 yen per share of the interim dividend. At the year-end dividend, the dividend forecast was already being announced at 40 yen per share, so the full year dividend forecast of 190 yen remains unchanged. If it could turn to slide 6. This is the total picture of profit and loss statement. The first revenue for the first half was 1,546.4 billion yen and that was a 30% of increase in revenue. Now, the infrast systems had a slight decrease in revenue, however, for the other segments, all the segments, the five-infrast systems was increased its revenue. Operating income was 45 billion yen. There were the revenue increase on top of that. Weaker yen had positive impact at 41.9 billion yen increase year over year. The non-overading income and loss related to, for example, equity method companies such as Kyokxia, there's a positive of 37.1 billion yen. In total, income before income taxes was 82.1 billion yen, which is an increase of 62 billion yen. After that, income taxes were deducted and the net profit for this year is 59.8 billion yen, which was an increase of 56.3 billion yen year over year. Moving on to page 7, This is the operating income analysis compared to a year ago. Far left is the first half operating income of FY 2020, which was 3.1 billion yen. During the first half of FY 2020, the restructuring cost of 7.8 billion was posted, so we reversed back this amount and the operating income with that impact of restructuring cost was about 11 billion yen. And there are recovery from COVID pandemic and there are 40 billion yen of the revenue will be added and, presumably, the revenue is approximately 50 billion yen. And according to our business plan, in order to streamline the overseas offices and locations, we have posted about 5 billion yen worth of a restructuring cost, and therefore, as a result, operating income for the first half of FY21 was 45 billion yen. As is mentioned at the outset, there are more visible impact arising from bessoring material and logistics costs as well as semiconductor shortages. And as this boxes on top of the chart explained that a shortage of the semiconductor products is affecting as a reduction of the revenue as a result the revenue negative impact was about 6 billion yen. On that hand, the soaring material and logistics cost is considered as a part of the cost increase as a result. The cost increase was about 14 billion yen. At a total, there was the income reduction impact of 20 billion yen also. On page 8, non-operating income, as I said earlier, the equity in earnings of affiliate improved because mainly due to the yield set increase of profit by 16.8 billion yen. Therefore, for the first half in fiscal year 2021, that 37.1 billion was recorded up 20.1 billion yen from my ear earlier. Page 9, free cash flow positive 131.4 billion yen as I said at the outset and there was a cash out of the negative 53.1 billion yen cash flow from investing activities however due to that collection on AR at the end of a previous fiscal year in the receipt of the advances of large projects that cash flow from operating activities with positive 184.5 billion yen. And the bottom half provides the equity, attributable shareholders of the company, which decreased by 81.7 billion yen. The share, due to the share repurchase of 100 billion yen, an ear-end special dividend payout of 81.7 billion yen, and 1 trillion and the 45.2 billion yen was recorded. And the shareholder equity ratio was 30.5% and page 10 is the breakdown of what we have already explained and the shareholders equity ratio the net interest of bearing debt was 47.5 billion yen. And page 11, explanation by segment and page 12 is also by segment. As I explained earlier, excluding infrastructure system most increased in both sales and profit. And here is the energy system on page 13. Net sales was 236 billion yen, operating income was 4.5 billion yen. Net sales increased by 45.9 billion yen from a year earlier, as you can see here. The net sales increase in both power generation system transmission and distribution. Given this increase in net sales, operating income also improved by 12 billion yen from the previous year. Page 14. The top half provides infrastructure systems and solutions. Net sales were 272.1 billion yen, operating income was 0.3 billion yen. Public infrastructure, sales increased however in industrial systems with impact of pandemic still remaining and the net sales in the entire segment decreased by 9.9 billion yen and operating income as well on top of the decrease because of the decrease in net sales and cost of restructuring industrial systems. And recently there was an increase in cost in overseas projects in railways, therefore segment as a whole, so the decrease in operating income by 6.2 billion yen for the first half. The bottom half provides the results for building the solution. Net sales were 285.8 billion yen and operating income of 10.2 billion yen. Net sales recovered mainly in the air conditioning business and therefore net sales increased by 26.5 billion yen. And on the other hand, operating income due to the increase in net sales. And although there were negative impacts of the material cost increase and a logistic cost increase, and its impact of shortage of semiconductors, elevator escalator, business in particular, and also impacts of the forex and the ordino operating income was almost a flat. On page 15, device and storage net sales were 432.9 billion yen, which was up 108.9 billion yen from a year earlier. operating income was 34.7 billion yen, which is up 30.1 billion yen year on year. Semi-conductors and hard disk drive net increase, net sales increase mainly due to the recovery from the impact of pandemic and driven by the increase in sales and the impact of the forex and also effects of the restructuring which was conducted last year, income increased and in others and had a risk. In the same period last year, the operation ratio of the plant in the Philippines was reduced, the significant due to, mainly due to pandemic. Therefore, there was an increase of sales to data centers during this fiscal year. The gross ratio has been significant. Site 16. The upper half is retail and printing solutions. It sells 221.7 billion and operating income 4.3 billion. So it is in black compared to last making last year. Similarly, recovery from the COVID and also last year we conducted the restructure reform with this retail and both printing has achieved an increase in sales and also income. The bottom half is digital solutions. Mainly by the increase of the Page 17, amount of orders received and also the order backlog for the three years the trend is given on the left is the amount of orders received. For the first half the orders received compared ear on ear 19%, mainly in the energy system similar to FY19. In FY21 as well, there were orders of large scale projects. And if you move to the right part, which is the order backlog, order backlog also is steadily increasing. Then, please take a look at page 19. It is the equity earnings from Kyoksea. And for the figures I already mentioned earlier, if you take a look at the right part, BitGross and also ASP difference change is given in the bold font is that for the BID growth higher 10% range we are seeing quite a growth and for ASP, mid-single digit increase. Compared to three months before, first quarter, the price increase is becoming more slower. Page 20 explains about how we completed our share-repurchase plan. Site 21 and beyond is about the full-ear forecast for FY21 full-ear. For net sales, $3,350 billion yen. And compared to what we announced three months before, it is an upward revision of $100 billion. For income before tax and net income as Kyuxia's portion is unknown for the six months ahead. So this is just as of reference. In the first half, there was a 200, excuse me, 20 billion upward revision from Kyokxia equity earnings. So we have made an upward revision for the income before tax and also net income. For operating income and free cash flow, we maintain the previous forecast and there is no change. Site 23 is a forecast by segment. At the very right column, it gives the difference between the previous forecast and ounce three months before. A little lower than the middle divides and storage. For the revenue, 80 billion upward revision for net sales. However, having said that, out of this 80 billion, Kyokia memory resale is still included, which accounts for about half. So in real terms, semiconductor or hard-ride related gross increase in revenue is about 40 billion. And one column above retail and printing solutions, As Toshibatak already announced their figures and their overseas retail is very strong also with the Wieger Gänd we have made an upward vision of 20 billion. As they made this upward vision, we also reflected the same. And as I mentioned, for the company wide, operating income, no change, but by segment building solutions, especially retail printing, toshiba tech, because of the soaring material and logistic costs, lack of semiconductors, each segment compared to the previous announcement made a downward revision by 5 billion. On the other hand, in the first half, device and storage has been very strong, so in net it is a 15 billion increase in profit. Slide 24. Similar to first half analysis on the left is FY20, 104.4 billion operating profit and we had 17.5 billion restructuring cost. So this is reversed. It will mean that we have an operating profit income of 120 billion. In addition to this, if you go a little to the right on a planned basis we have the restructuring and 21 billion. Also, excuse me, restructuring cost of 10 billion and also fixed costs increased for 21 billion, half of that, at depreciation and also half is for R&D. With these expenses cost increasing, but with the increased in revenue and also with the effect of the restructuring, which will offset the increase of a cost and 170 billion profit is achievable. Lack of semiconductor and also the soaring material price, as I mentioned earlier, that is illustrated in the balloon. So that was about the second quarter results explanation. Thank you very much. That concludes the presentation part of the session. Now we'd like to move on to the Q&A session. And the question will be taken by Mr. Chirakawa, Mr. Atazawa, Mr. Hirataa, as well as the four members joining via online. And when there are questions, please state your name. Now, we will have 30 minutes questions to be picked up from the members of the field media. and let me label it on the message of taking questions. The questions are only be collected from the people who were registered beforehand and if you have any questions please press Asterix and 1. It is not a pound, but it is the Asterix.

If you're not speaking and hearing the answers, please mute yourself in order not to disrupt by the noises from your end such as typing keyboards. Now we'd like to enter the conventions from Mr. Yao of Niepon Niekei. The Seheyo of Niekei. can you hear us? Thank you very much for the presentation. First off, regarding the separation into three entities, what are the flows of discussion that resulted in this conclusion? Well, between the Saba is a question of the Now, this is Sunakaba. May I answer to your question. Now, as is mentioned earlier, executive side and also the board meeting have had the meetings almost every week for the last five months. There were many strategic options that we discussed and also that were reviews of the medium term plan that we have compiled. And also we at the SRC had had a discussion about the potential privatization with partners, so we have compared many options. Now, we came in regard to the ideas of tax-free spin-off while we were discussing discussing and after the end of the discussion between SRC and the board we came up with this idea. And as PowerPoint had mentioned the executive CM management side had a very confident in pursuing this option of the tax-free spin-off. I believe that this is the best possible path forward for Toshiba. That is all. Thank you very much. Are there any other options that we have discussed? Could you elaborate on that? Could you repeat the question? So when the spinoff idea surfaced and SRC or the CMS meant who was the first one to say? And were there any other options regarding other options? Well, SRC will issue a report at a later date about how the discussion has developed. It was about 10 pages long, a document that we intend to publish in due course, but it was several months ago that this particular idea surfaced. And SRC, we at the management and advisors, all parties involved and made a discussion. In the course of the whole discussion, we came up with the idea of tax-free spin-off and the feasibility of that idea was recognized as a viable option and ultimately we came up with the idea of a separation into the Now regarding the future growth, now spinoff is just talking about the institution. It is means, but how are you going to make growth in real-term basis that I'd like to explore with you? Reason is that in regard to the Tushma Next Plan in FY25, $4 trillion of the net sales and $400 billion of operating income and 10% of operating income margin, that was a target. And a total of the three entities, you'll be able to exceed that initial target. And in the case of the changeable, the source of growth is coming from the technology developed by R&D. And what is the source of the development and how you're going to separate that into three entities? Could you enable it on that? I think the answer is that the question is to talk about the growth potential. And as page 8 describes, there are three rectangles. And from left and right, real-to-use speaking, that these are considered shareholders where we are changing the entity entity structures and simplify the operation so that we can materialize the value and thereby providing more options for the shareholders. But in regard to the growth of the square in the middle, where the forecast and agile management, that will be the largest difference vis-à-vis other ideas. To give you some specific ideas, and for example, as Misha Hatazawa mentioned earlier, the power semiconductor to be grown and then the investment into 300 millimeters was made. And that is something that I reflect upon now that semicher is in shortages nowadays and in retrospect probably a year before our decision or at least six months before our actual decision that the investment had had to be made but there were headquarters and the substrates and there are the topics, the intermediates and others. And therefore, it took quite a long time to make final decisions. And in terms of agility, there are something that we have personally flipped upon. And therefore, looking at each market, the competition situation and the peers that are competitive landscape that we need to carefully look at and the focus and the very small management will have to make very agile decisions so that we can compete well in the global market. So that's why we decided to separate the entities in this way. I personally believe that so. And in regard to a next question, how the number will play out? In regard to the specific targeted numbers when we discussed with Sheahorus as SRC has mentioned earlier that Toshiba always make the three-year medium-term plan in the year three, so we had never had achieved the results and the target. And that was actually a criticism that we have to face up. And we are thinking about the feasible number, and we incorporate that into this presentation. I just wanted to add that to my comment. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. As explained by Mr. Nakawa earlier regarding the statement by the Board. It has been already released on our press release webpage titled, The Processes Reading to the spin of plan by the board of directors of the company and that is already released on our website. Bloomberg, Mr. Furukawa, this is Furukawa of Bloomberg speaking. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. I have two questions. May I ask two questions at once? Yes, please. I have questions to Sena Kawasan regarding this reorganization. I understood advantage is very well, but changing the organization of the company. There will be risks incurred and potential demerits as well. In reorganization process, I think that you are going to explain this to employees and other stakeholders like business partners. Do you think that the all stakeholders will understand this and accept this? the shares will be partly purchased and most of the net proceeds will be returned to the shareholders. And this time are you going to divest all the shares held by the company and could you please explain whether the plan stays unchanged and an IPO policy related to Kyokxia, and do you still keep the strategy or policy to keep the Kyokxia IPO? And regarding merits and demerits and in the competitive landscape there are advantages regarding the creative capabilities of Toshiba. As in the question asked by the reporter from Nikkei, I couldn't respond to that regarding the research laboratories. Were there any concerns about that? He asked that question as well. And researchers and staffers in principle'm going to be divided into two companies, standalone companies. There needs to be a system of process allowing the exhibition of capabilities and we would like to work out the details related to the basic research at the research laboratories and that is the remaining challenge for us. We have to work on that but in principle, staffers will be divided into two standalone companies to promote individual companies. Semi-conductor energy and infrastructure, the core weight of the management strategy will be changed. But we believe that the disadvantage will outweigh disadvantages. And as you said, we would like to come up with a system to improve the situation related to any potential disadvantages in your question. Regarding your second question about Kyokse, whatever which will exceed the appropriate level of capital will be returned to shareholders. And earlier, a majority of stake, the net seats proceeds from the sale of the Kyok's shares will be returned to shareholders and considering the current financial position. Everything in excess of the appropriate capital, well, we thought that even if when we return all the proceeds from the sale to shareholders, we would be able to sustain the financial structure. So this time we said that all the proceeds will be returned to shareholders. Of course anything related to the spinoff will be kept. The IPOs policy which they unchanged. This is to be determined by Bing. Therefore, this is not something we are able to determine. But following the decision by Bing, we like to be cooperative with them so that we can be prepared. Thank you. Next NHK, Schmeissmann, please. This is Schmeiss from NHK, do you hear me okay? Yes. I would like to ask Snagara-san, is about disadvantage of the separation plant and there was a mention about the R&D. It's a three trillion yen cell size by splitting that, separating that. So size-wise it will be smaller, first of all. So, but still do you believe that you will be viable with the smaller size? And also I would like to ask Mr. Brof is that privatization has been often mentioned and this time, so the three entities being listed. So that is quite the contrary with privatization. So have you given up with the privatization and if you have given up with the privatization, so what was the reason in the cause? So can I hear from him? So first Mr. Srinakawa will respond and then we will be switching the image camera and also the voice to connect to Mr. Brof. So the question was about threegen being split and separated if whether we are concerned about that. For energy, infrastructure business, 2 trillion worth of business in size and semiconductor device, 4- device storage 1 trillion, a little less than 1 trillion. So this is sizable quite sized and we are aiming for a fresh start. And so we are willing to start a very fresh start for the financial position so we do not have any concerns. On the other hand, the two entities will be able to have a very agile management in their business and a very focused manner that is in a large advantage. So I think I will switch to Mr. Brof, switching the image and also the voice. Thank you Chairman. As Chairman Sunakawa has mentioned we have uploaded this afternoon the SRC's 10 page letter, which I think is probably unprecedented, explaining the journey that the SRC as well as the board has been through for the last five months. And within that letter, you will see a section related to the potential privatization of Toshiba and all of the work that we did on that particular option. But what we ultimately decided was that the plan that we presented today, the separation plan offered more flexibility to our shareholders and was in fact better as far as a long term growth and value of the sheba corporations concerned. So we believe the plan is the best for our shareholders. When we began the SRC exercise, there was a view expressed by some shareholders, but not all that we should be going straight to an auction process. But frankly, our fiduciary duties require us to explore all options and through that process the separation plan was developed. The reason for the separation plan is actually explained in the letter and it arose from with the strategic partners in a very deep manner for a stage, second stage, third stage, and many layers. There was discussion and each partner, example regulatory risk also about the antitrust also Kyokzvya that the price is difficult and unclear and we did not come to a very clear cut pricing. And that is also mentioned in the report. So I hope that you will read to the report. That is all for myself. So did you say that with the partners you already had discussion with about the general shareholder meeting? Do we are confident in what we have announced and explained and we are asking for the endorsement and to seek opinions from these shareholders we are expecting to hold EGM during January March. Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity. May I ask a question to Mr. Tuna Pava, separation into three entities. When we look at it from a different point of view, General comprehensive electric company, that idea has already been given up on and then this is a despondent of the company. What do you think of this opinion? Well, let me answer that being a comprehensive electric trucking company, be it a TV, a personal computer, and home appliances and medical that I used to belong to. There's nothing of the business already. And therefore, we are no longer comprehensive electronic player. However, social infrastructure and device business in semiconductors, these two entities, you mentioned that this is a disbondlement, but in my opinion, this is an evolution for the future. So it is not a disbondlement, but it is an evolution for the future. So we would like to be very confident in moving forward to the future. May I ask a second question if I may? Now, the reorganization plan this time, what is the impact of the employment as well as the closure of your operating sites. Well, impact on the employment, I would not expect so, but that also requires a further explanation to the society at large. So that's the policy that we'd like to take going forward in regard to the closure of the operating sites. The plan does not complete with the announcement of the plan. Announcement of the plan is the starting point for the future evolution. This is the starting point for further development. And therefore, we will continue with the portfolio review, Kefto allocation policies. And we are poised to do that going forward. And on top of that, it's necessary. There's nothing be decided at this point in time, but we may conclude that perhaps the closure of the site is more rational, but we have started our path toward evolution. And therefore, in the Minister of our course of actions, there will be other opportunities as well. Last question, if I may. The governance enhancement committee report that I'd like to ask about in In that report, the former senior executive officers have engaged in acts in violation of the corporate ethics. And based on that, although the duty was already released from the former executives and still you are asking for them to pay back their renumerization and also the some damages are loaded to be made and what do you think of that? Well, first, the reason of the report was compiled that perhaps induced by the independent investigative report that perhaps the AGM wasn't organized in a fair manner, such as interfering with the voting activities of the shareholders and so forth. And then we, as a company, committed to the receipt of the independent investigative report in the very shares in CCI-Amana. It is not the legal decision whether that was acceptable or not. It is just the fact that we received the report from investigators and also some of the board's traits were rejected by the Shearihuruz and we believe that the pressure issue was the covenants issue of this company. That is awareness. So it wasn't about what had happened in the past. It was about the evolutions for the future. And without having the redevelopment of the governance structure of this company, the supply and supply will not be executed quite well. And therefore, as soon as possible, we would like to reorganize or redevelop the governance structure of this company. The full report of the governance enhancement committee was now published and I look at the fourth quarter regarding theatter regarding the recurrence prevention measures. And there were four major points was raised and how we are going to rebuild the governance of this company. How are we going to rebuild the governance? I'd like to highlight in my activities going forward in the company, I do not intend to just reflect upon what had happened in the past. We just make very sincere reflection about this. And it always, the case that the company would say that we thought something bad had happened and we will change going forward. That's not what we are going to do. We will do a serious exercise of such as brainstorming and discussions and we would like to be very strenuous of implementing the Recurrence Permission of Materials and I would like to spend a lot of time for that. Are you suggesting that what had happened has a bygone? So bygone speed bygone and you are going to focus on more forward-looking actions going forward. Is that a case? Well, compensation committee as Ms. Waddahiki mentioned, perhaps a compensation committee may discuss something about what had happened in the past, but personally, I've actually just count on the presidential committee for the decisions to come in the future. Kaudot. I have question to Mr. Tsubnakala regarding this decision. In the process leading to this decision, the completion of the board has been reduced from 13 by 5 members. And, Tana Khalsan, you are serving as the president as well, and on the board as well. So, I wonder how this decision was reached. So could you please give us your take on this? Yes, chairperson of the board is served as temporary position and also for the president position. We needed to find a successor as soon as possible. Of course, the successor plan is being formed by any company. So anyway, this is something that should be determined by the nomination committee. So I will follow the decision by the committee. But for the current position and duties and responsibility, I would like to dedicate myself to fulfill these duties. So do you have the idea that you are going to continue to serve in order to accomplish this spin-off. Well, at the board, the current board serving, well, I think that by when I'm going to serve on the board, this is to be determined by the nomination committee's soul. But as far as we have this plan for the spinoff, and I would like to continue to dedicate myself. And Mr. Krumatami resigned. And he was engaged in saying that he will respect the engagement with shareholders. And I think that if there was no influence by the activists, do you think that you didn't? You had been reaching this decision this time around. Well, when you say activists, and in this process, we could learn a lot from the engagement with shareholders, particularly in relation to governance. There are many things that we could learn. Irrespective of whether or not shareholders are active or not, but this time in order to enhance the value of the company and to enhance the shareholders' value, we believe that this was the right decision three years ago in 2018. Toshiba Nextplan was formulated and at that time, the company's goal was to, through maximization of corporate value, TSL, total shareholder return is to be enhanced. This is what we said. So TSR or shareholder value to be maximized. That is what we said. And this policy has not changed at all. And this time, for the purpose of increasing the shareholder value or expanding the CSR, and this separation plan is very reasonable towards the future. We needed to make evolution. We believe that this is a very important one step towards that. Thank you very much. From Diane Monde, symbol Nissan, please. From Diane Monde, Simbogisan, please. From Jaya Monde, my name is Simbogie speaking. On a related note, I would like to ask, is it about the top management positions and I do have several questions. Within the ear to find a successor and also the chair of the board meeting and I understand that it will be difficult to find a successor within the calendar year. I would like to know whether that is correct and also what the reason. And perhaps Mr. Braff from the nomination committee or anyone who is suitable to answer. I hope that would be answered. And also my next question is about the separation plan into three entities about the President, CEO and the would that impact the finding the successor of the chairman and also when do you want to decide on the new management? So at the first question, we would like to ask Mr. Bofta and please wait as we will be switching the image and also the line. With regard to the separation plan, we should be able to recruit and retain people with more specialist skills rather than the generalist skills that are needed to run a conglomerate. And once we have the support of our shareholders, we will be on a course to start recruiting people for our respective boards. But that's a little bit early in the day at the moment. But of course the intention is to have appropriately qualified boards with industry experience to to run those two spindle businesses. I think beyond that we are going to go to our shareholders for an EDM in March. I think once we've got that endorsement we should be putting forward some more candidates for Toshiba Corporation 6502 to assist the board in particular with regard to the audit committee. Thank you. Excuse me, the EGN should be much and the translator mistakenly announced that it was May. About the outside board, directors deciding by December that plan and there was a question on that point and the reason. So this time, there's much strategic options and we had this change in course and within the process unless it was fixed and as we were not able to recruit and appoint someone so that was what was mentioned at the nomination committee. I am not a member of the nomination committee. So the first priority was placed on to creating and specify the separation plan that was the priority. That was the supplementary explanation. So, in that example, we will move to the next question. Next, take a look at the view of Kisei, please. Can you hear me? Yes, very well. This is Takaji of To You, Kisei. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would like to follow up the previous question. May I ask once again and confirm. Now, the chairperson of the company, for your company, what is the selection process? Well, the question is that, is it notan San, are you going to serve as an intermature person to, until the spirit separation of the companies? May I confer once again? And I'd like to ask another question at this juncture that the company will be separated into three entities. And the third one, which is considered to be the current Toshiba portion, that the Kyokshia's Aztecs will be owned and also Toshiba Tech shareholder is going to be Toshiba. But do you think that Toshiba will disappear in the future? I just wondered the chairperson and CEO in the future regarding that outside the lecturers are comprising the nomination committee so it is up to the nomination committee's decision so at this point in time there's nothing that we know of and therefore it is up to the nomination committees to discuss going forward. Now regarding what would happen that the legacy Toshiba, what would happen on that entity, will the Toshiba, will earn the ownership stake of Kyokxia and for Kyokxia's ownership, we would like to monetize into the cash as soon as possible. And for Toshiba Tech, positioning is completely different. Well, Kyoksha is a pretty method applicable company and the Toshiba Tech is fully consolidated, listed as a subsidiary. What we call data business, for, there's nothing decided at this point. We are working on digitalization at the data business and Toshiba Tech learns many data and Toshiba Tech Business is indispensable for Toshiba overall. So what would happen for that entity? Currently there are the heavy data and also brand management issue as well. We need to discuss about the details going forward. So that is the current situation. Thank you. Now, do you have clear pathways for the investors and so forth? No, none. Are you asking about tech? Correct. The tech for the Tochua Tech, nothing is decided. May I ask a further question. Relationship of the three entities. Once these are spin off and it will be different independent entities. I'm not sure if it's level or not. However, for example, cross-holding about shares, for example, among the three entities, would that be a viable option under the laws in regularization Japan, cross-shareholding of three entities as impossible? So we will not have a cross-sharing of the shares. Thank you very much. Next TV Tokyo, Abesam, please. This is Abbe of TV Tokyo. Can you hear me? Yes. In this press conference that materials are titled the transforming toshi bat to enhance shareholder value. And it used to be to enhance corporate value, but it has been changed to enhance shareholder value. Is it correct? Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure. The shareholder value should be enhanced. That was the word we finalized and by maximizing corporate value and then shareholder value will be also enhanced. So, in the end, ultimately shareholder value will be enhanced. As the means to do that, and then corporate value should be increased, so TSR should be expanded. So, as the final point to reach, we wrote the shareholder value. The reason why I asked this question, according to what I heard from the company's people and the current management team, maybe people are looking only towards the shareholders within the management team, and that is the criticism that we have heard from the people in the company, activists, so particularly in particular shareholders are considered most, and in preparation of this material. So, Naka-wasa, you mentioned that there are a lot of discussions, management team and the topic sectors of the subsidiaries and so forth. So, have you, I believe that there was only limited discussion with the top executives of the subsidiaries or operating companies and it was out of the blue for them. Do you think that you have obtained understanding from the internal people about this plan. We have been continuing to say, since three years ago when Toshiba next to plan was announced, that TSL should be enhanced. We have been keeping to say the same thing, but of course, shareholders, stakeholders, stakeholders, but of course, the society at large and employees, all the stakeholders should be valued. And this is our policy, which has stayed unchanged. and this time again, we do not change this policy at all by having this separation into three companies and then we believe that we will be able to provide appropriate services to customers and there will be incentives and various benefits and merits for employees as well, based upon the business cycle of each company after separation. And as an overall, for all the stakeholders, we believe that this decision is going to be the best option. Current shareholders will obtain the shares of the two standalone companies which will be listed on the market. Regarding the percentage, the mix or percentage of the shares to be allocated, do you think that this will be reflecting the current values? Well, I think that will be determined when the spinoff is completed. We do not have anything that has been clarified. Well, nothing clarified. Then the structure of the shareholding ownership structure is different. But I think there will be an option for shareholders to choose. Based upon the same ratio, I think maybe I should defer this question to CHE4. So in two years, sometime in two years from today, the ownership structure will be divided, I mean shares of the Toshiba held by Sherwooders will be divided and Sherwooders will be provided with the different shares in each company, each entity. So it will depend on the decision of shareholders regarding what to do with those allocated shares. And I think there is uncertainty whether or not the company will be able to maintain R&D functions. For example, in the case of infrastructure company, infrastructure business and the QKD business of course quantum encryption it will cost a lot of money in R&D activities. So after separating into two entities and research laboratories will be also divided into two. So do you think that you can be able to maintain such capabilities that Toshiba cutting edge technology can be really maintained? I think there needs to be more clearer forecast or outlook regarding this. Okay, I'd like to defer to Hata Zavasan. Within the numbers represented, CAPEX, R&D expenditures are explained for the coming three years. And according to the current plan, the gross plan to be supported by the gross funds as you know to be spent in the R&D and the CapEx. So these are estimated to be more aggressively spent R&D expenditures. In addition to the ratio of R&D expenditure in the total sales, which has been increased by 1% or 2% point, so overall we are going to put more focus on the R&D. And in terms of division into device and infrastructure and content of the research, it will depend on the wear in the business areas such activities can be allocated to and then the expenditures or efforts will be divided. As Tuna Ka-san mentioned and basic research, we would like to avoid the negative impacts of the spin-off. We will consider that in the process of spin-off completion. And R&D is continues to be important for the company. So we will continue to be even more aggressively in spending in the R&D. Lastly, have you already reported this plan to Metis? If so, what was the feedback? What was the reaction from Metis? Yes, we went to explain this to them in advance. I don't think there was any negative feedback from them. Thank you very much. So it is about time, so we would like to take the last question, Nikke business, please. This is called a different Nikke business. Do you hear me okay? Thank you. So I have three last questions, two to Snakasan. So by the Kyokse shares. So in order to solve the excessive net operating loss, I believe that it was being used. So we have the device company. So I don't think you need to be desperate to sell the shares. And if you keep the shares in stake, perhaps you can see some energy. But are you still willing to determine to sell the stake? And the second one is about the separation plan. So I think this special resolution will be required at the EGM, but I think that the special resolution to be attained is going to be very hard, high hurdle. And also, I believe that the split, the opinion is quite split. Is that is what I heard? Within the SRC, so why not sell to the PE fund but this separation plan was supported? So could you reiterate the reason because I did not find and the explanation the reasoning? So could I be answered? So myself, Tanaka, about these Kyokseya steak shares. So why not seek synergy with the semiconductor business? Memory business will require massive investment and even with the current financial position we have decided no longer to continue and so instead to monetize the stake so that has been already decided from the before and there is no change to this policy and about the two-third special resolution 2023 so until that point as I mentioned earlier this reform is just the beginning and it is sort of a declaration and so in the meantime there will be further reform that is coming to come and will be executed also capital policy as well and also for the shareholders that we will be endorsed and be supported we will make the effort. And Mr. Buff could you respond please? The SRC's letter to shareholders, which was published this afternoon, goes into some detail about the process we followed with regard to private equity. It was quite an exhaustive process going through several rounds with credible bias and at the end of the day the separation plan came about principally because of the difficulty in valuing the keyoxious shares at this time. And the separation plan was therefore regarded as superior to the private equity plan from a quantitative and qualitative aspect. So if you like, the separation plan emerged from our earlier discussions with regard to the management plan, with regard to possible minority investors, and with regard to private equity solutions. That's how it came about. Thank you. Did I answer your question? Now we'd like to close the sessions for the media. Next, we'd like to invite the social analyst and financial institutions to take up some questions. So those of you who were not picked up as a questionnaire, please be trapped your questions by pressing asterisk too. Now we'd like to open the sessions for the analyst and the investors and please enter your question by pressing asterisk and one. City Group, EZawa San, please. This is EZawa of City Group. Can you all hear me? Thank you very much. Two questions at this point. Until recently, now, they clearly identified the Norcore business or the divestitures of some part of the business or possibly to discuss that the company is themes and now the company has concluded that the spin-off is a option. But in terms of the divestitures compared to spin-off, well, compared to the divestitures versus spin-off, why did you conclude that spin-off generates the larger upslides in the company's shareholder value? And what is the benefit of having split? So could you elaborate on that specifically? That is the first question. Second question is, pertaining to the presentation by Tineawa Sun at the outset that business portfolio will opt for further revisions and portfolio re-adignment going forward. That's how I understood your presentation. Ultimately, the Intosiable group, what would be the desirable ways of how told about would be like in the future? I think it would be beyond what you have decided on in two years time, beyond that, as a result of the spin spin off. Do you think that a complete and separate industry entity would be ultimate form of the company or do you see further realignment of the company? Do you have any visions beyond two years time? Now question one and two, I think some parts are interlinked so at the beginning in the medium term plan, inclusive known core and core, it is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and known core. It is true that the management has discussed about possible segregation of the core and noncore. But we tried to focus on what the companies they would be in the near future. So that was the focal point this time. And therefore, the identifying versus non-core that is actually on the ongoing discussion at this moment as well and we will continue that discussion going forward as well. So what we have announced this time is just a starting point of improving the value going forward. So there will be two new codes and as soon as possible, they will prepare the business plan on their own and we'd like to provide opportunities so that two new goals will be able to present their own business plan for the future. Going back to the first question, what is the strengths and what was the advantage of the split idea versus the divestitures. There are three squares in the previous presentations and IMCEO of this company and therefore cash flow from the main business is the core challenge for me and that is the main theme in my opinion and for forecast and agile business management. It's the very important point in my view. Sorry, I'm talking too long, but in retrospect, I've been serving as CEO and COO for a very long time for this company. And what I remorse about is that we were able to, you were not able to exercise the gross strategy property. So at the right timing, we'd like to make an investment at the appropriate timing. We'd like to be very agile. And we have very good technologies at the highest or top in the world and we'll be able to use our marketing capabilities in a very quick and agile way. A question remains as is. So because of this split at this time, I hope that a single management who have specialized knowledge about this area will be able to make a very agile decision. I hope that this particular shortcoming of myself will be resolved in the separation of the businesses. So I try to answer two questions at once. It didn't satisfy yourself. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next. From SMBC Niko Securities, Yoshizumi Sangh. This is Yoshizumi of SMBC Niko Securities. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you very much. I have two questions. First question is through separation to unlock value. What is the concrete image of unlocking value through spinoffoff, congruent merit discount will be resolved. I think that was the basis. So are you sure that this congruent merit discount can be resolved? So could you please give us your specific opinion? In fiscal year 2021-23, the operating income of 200 billion yen, which is rather conservative and infrastructure service in Roik, is still 10%. I think earlier, in fresh products, in be secured. So I think that there will be the improvement room. But after this split and then 10% ROIC and then do you think that the congruent merit discount can be really cleared or resolved? So this is my first question about your expectation on these points. Okay, I would like to respond first and I would like to ask Hata Zavasan to supplement. And this time, unlocking the value. This is the headline, but the purpose itself is not to resolve the congruent merit discount. We need to clarify the structure so that each individual standalone company will be able to manage their business respectively and easy to understand manner as a result the performance will be better. So it will lead to that resolution of the Congromeretta discount. This is what I am feeling. Regarding numbers. I said earlier the numbers that can be achievable because we have been pointed out about the lack of achieving whatever commitment we have been making in the past. So there was the criticism from the sources on the market. So that's why we came up with these numbers which seem to be sure to be achieved. Hatazawa is going to supplement and in 2025 and towards 2030 we presented a plan towards those years and internally we have that forecast or targets for 2025. And based upon the opinion from external parties, we were asked to secure the delivery on the committed numbers. So that's why we came up with the conservative plan. And we are showing the plan for the coming three years alone. And in fiscal year 24, 25, we have a plan inside the company and we'd like to disclose those plans that appropriate opportunity and we talked about the importance of investing in R&D activities and the results will be realized in fiscal year 24 and 25. And external parties, particularly listening to the voices of shareholders and within the short period of time until fiscal year 23, what can be achieved and what can be achieved in the short term should be presented. So you may think that these numbers seem to be a little weak, but I'm sorry, that was the basis for coming up with this number. And we wanted to incorporate some risk buffers. So that's why we came up with this plan. That's all. Thank you. Thank you very much. My second question is for CFO. In the coming two years share buyback in the level of 100 billion yen you said and is it related to the sale of the shares in Kyokia or it is not included in the buyback plan and utilizing NOL and then what will be the advantage benefits of the tax issues at the time of a sale. So a qualitative comment will be okay. So could you please give us your comment? Thank you very much for your question. Regarding your first question, as Mr. Akhava mentioned, at our company, we have a yardistic of so-called appropriate level of capital. So, capital exceeding that appropriate level will be returned to shareholders. That's what we have been saying as Hatatavasam mentioned earlier in 2021, this current fiscal year and this coming 22. In these years, we came up with this rather sure plan. Therefore, we will be able to achieve this net income number. So considering all these, and according to our calculation, we will be able to return in the order of about 100 billion yen to shareholders. So regarding the gains from the sale of Kiaoksha shares is outside of this number and regarding the NOL, net operating loss, as you know, according to the tax law for the current fiscal year, half of the amount recorded in the fiscal year can be utilized. So based on the balance sheet that there is a NOL in the amount of about 300 billion yen. So how and when Kyokshia, Kyokshia stake in Kyokshia can be sold at any point. So if at that time if we still have the NOL and then about half of the gains obtained through the sale of Kia or Kia or Kia or Kia will be offset by the NOL. Thank you very much understood. Thank you. Next. UBS. Yes, please. Thank you. UBS. This is Yesi speaking. Yes, we hear you. I have one question, but there are three aims in asking my one question. So this announcement about how management is done, also how the business exists, I am sure that there was a lot of discussion on these matters. So the ideal state of Tushiba, what do you believe is the most ideal? I know that it could be something unrealistic, but could you explain about the ideal state of Toshiba? The reason I am asking, there are three reasons. What do you think the issue of Toshiba is? And the process, not how you reflected, but if there's anything in a event that has led you to the process and also second part is that when selecting the management of the new separated company, when you want to hand over to the new management, what is your ambition, what is your hope that the new management to realize, and also the three part is that the USGE also have decided the separation. So I believe that separation spinoff is now being questioned and this is something beyond shareholders. So what is the significance meaning of separation? I understand being agile, that is one of the advantage, but also this hasn't said from the early 2000s. And so why now today separation spin off is being decided does that reflect something in society so these are my questions I would like to respond and if any of the two of my colleagues have anything to add. So what is the ideal state? So I know that this will differ, but for myself, when we have a business and we are trying to solve the social issues around us and that is what is happening on a daily basis and the repetition. Personally, the company brand that is nothing that is not where I am particular about. Well, medical social medical some went to kind of medical and would give it a COVID situation. And MRI, for example, very well, and a well positioned in Japan globally, which is very... And although I'm sad that Oshiba name is gone, but what I have done is contribute to society and see it growing that itself makes me very happy. So, in the same sense, in the same notes, that what we are doing in our business that our employees being satisfied and also contributing to society, I think that is the ideal way, ideal state. So even in the form that it is split into two or more with the name changes, but our mission itself, how we execute and realize the mission, I think that is the important part. And so I was questioning myself, what is the ideal state? I know that I'm talking a lot, so perhaps this will be my response. And also, so asked what I expect towards a future management, especially the largest issue is governance. So when it comes to governance, this is going to be the fundamentals in management and governance has pointed out that although it may take some time that we want to reconstruct the governance and also with a new company management. There was a mention about what type is suitable and it is mentioned sometimes we will see someone from the outside of the market and also something with the capability of the governance perspective that is going to be some of the basics requirements qualifications. And it was just by chance that GE also announced that Nikkeit-Sleeq with that we were a little earlier in with our scheme to be known I don't know if this answers GSE sense question, but that is my impression. Do you have anything to add? There's also a response. I think that what each individual will be answering will be different. So this is my personal view. Myself, I believe that Toshiba's mission and philosophy is that what is asked for by Toshiba and we have the responsibility to execute our responsibility. So that is what we are required of and that is the reason of existence. So that is one thing. On the other hand, what clients, customers request us? Sometimes the time is different and also the requirement is different, meaning that sometimes we cannot make a management decision which has been pointed out as an issue, I think this applies to GE. The management environment has changed. Speed is required. So not luck at time in the past with a lot of things mixed in between. We will not be able to catch up and we cannot make a pure decision in order to survive. So that is why I believe that spinoff or separation could be one of the trend. We have the infrastructure, energy, and serve the clients in this industry and we believe that Toshiba may have only the answer and for the device and discs and also for the future information society. What is required of Sushiva? We need to create the solutions in a quickly manner that is requested by our clients. I think that is what we exist for and that is the reasoning for why we have decided on this decision and also it matches the needs. Also, let me also say a few words. From a financial position perspective, from a shareholder, we have the agreed and also we want to steadily increase the value. That is also the mission of the company. For this to happen, as Hadazasan mentioned, we need to win the trust of our client's customers and also we have to deliver the products and services that is required of. And what is most important is that the employees also share the same mission, look at the same direction, be aligned in the same mission. So eventually that will lead to increase the value for the shareholders and unlock the values. There are various means to realize this and given the current situation of Toshiba, what we have been discussing and what we are trying to execute, this framework is going to be the best path forward for the shareholders. I personally believe so. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next, we would like to invite from Goldman Sachs Mr. Harada please. This is Harada speaking from Goldman Sachs. Thank you. Can you all hear me? Thank you. Now, I would like to ask one question. Now, my question may sound very similar to the previous questions. Now, Infra services and device that you are going to separate into. And Infra services company itself is considered a congruent in my opinion when looked at the business structure. On the global basis, for example, elevators could be the vestigers going forward or carve it out going forward and going forward. Do you think that further realignment of military services in scope or in your vision at this point? And in addition, there are many congruent matters based companies in Japan. Be good or bad. your company is having a connection with Métis, then in order to enhance competitiveness of the overall corporate Japan, perhaps the real momentum of the company's evolving whole corporate society in Japan is perhaps considered. Was that a part of discussion with them? And also being a part of the concept of the Messiah, the same management, would that be also something that you would consider if good opportunity arises, are you conscious of this type of operation or opportunity? So if for a structured company, there are a variety of businesses included. However, there are some common denominators, for example, be it services and subscription models. And it is quite a high potential of sharing the commonality across the different businesses and infrastructure services. But like I mentioned earlier, portfolio review exercise will continue and there's nothing that we have decided at this point in time and yet we'd like to continue to discuss going forward. Now regarding regarding the realignment of the industries in Japan, my position is at least that we reviewed all possible opportunities and options exhaustively, Think about all the stakeholders such as shareholder, employees, and society, a large customer, and we'd like to review from that point of view. That is my position. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your comment. That is all. Thank you very much. Now, we'd like to entertain one last question at this point in time. SBI, it's an isam, please. Thank you very much. I have two questions regarding spin-off to list span of companies on the market. I am not experienced in this area so could you please give us timeline for new calls including their balance sheets. The treatment of such accounting will be starting from the third quarter of this fiscal year 21 and then in two years from today, and a spinoff will be completed. This is my understanding, is this correct? And the second question is about the company names of the new codes. Do you plan to name with Toshiba in the company's name, like Kyokshia or other? I think that in this scheme, I think the new company's name would be like the ones as Kyokxias. Regarding the timeline for the companies to be listed on the market, there needs to be a two-fiscal year is financial results to be audited. So therefore our target is in the second half of 23. Fiscal year 23, here are the some will supplement and regarding the company names, there is nothing that has been determined yet. We are going to 5. a little bit. I think on page 12 there was this schedule for timeline. We would like to observe and follow this timeline as much as possible and with some better ideas or devising the ideas we like to shorten this duration. As you can see here, there is a necessity for two fiscal years financial numbers to be audited. This is the requirement by TSE and for this fiscal year in 2022 the numbers operation is based upon the assumption that the current organizational structure will continue. And of course there are lots to be worked out with auditors and for fiscal year 2021 the financial results to be closed based on the current Toshiba organization and then that will be the basis for the new goals and then we would divide the numbers into two companies. Some point in fiscal year 2022, we like to finalize the numbers for the new companies to be established in parallel for fiscal year 2022 based on the current consolidation under the Toshiba group and financial statements will be prepared and based upon the three new codes we are going to create three separate financial statements so that we will be working in language the current timeline and regarding the internal control examination to be conducted by auditors as well. So of course for Toshiba Corporation on the current consolidation basis, of course we would continue operation for fiscal year 2022. So in parallel with that, based upon the new organizational structure, which will be created so that internal control will be functioning. So we will check whether internal control will be working well in those certain new organization structures. So it will be going to be complicated during 2022. Until the end of fiscal year 2022, current organization structure will be maintained. But in parallel, we will prepare gradually the separate balance sheets for three new companies. Of course, there are a lot to be done, but roughly speaking, this is our current plan. Thank you. Thank you very much. So otherwise as it will be the last. But there was one question left from the media, so we would like to take the last question. Mr. Vashoyo, do you see, are you still connected? So we will close the questions. So there is one correction. Snokeau are missioned. Is that about these spin off related? Is that there was a leak from the Nikkei article. It is not a leak by the company, so I want to make a correction. So thank you very much for all the participants coming to the press release and also those participating for the phone, please make sure that you hang off.\"}"
