Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So you know, you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on, everything gets done and things stay civil. And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would, I would have it all ready to go. I would have it all ready to go. I would have it all ready to go. I would have it all ready to go. I would have it all ready to go. I would have it all ready to go, but then actually the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. I knew for a paper like that, my normal workflow was not an option, it was way too big a project. So I planned things out and I decided it kind of had to go something like this is how the year would go. and I bump it up.\"}"
